<p>The establishment of an historic basis for this little romance
was fraught with many difficulties, owing to the
great divergence in statement and opinions to be found
in regard to the life and origin of <span class="smcap">Justin Morgan</span>. The
author was obliged to select from a mass of contradictory
material that which most nearly conformed with the
purpose and continuity of the story.</p>

<p>Therefore, if any find the <em>history</em> not to his way of
thinking she begs him to realize that it is, after all, but
a detail which she hopes may be compensated for by the
manner in which she has endeavored to bring out all
those noble characteristics for which the <span class="smcap">Founder of His
Race</span> was famous.</p>

<p>In the frontispiece, modelled by Roger Noble Burnham,
the portrait of Mistress Lloyd was posed for by
Miss Fifi Willis, of Columbia, Missouri, to whom the
author wishes to extend her thanks.</p>

</div>


<p>The human side of horse-nature may have been
touched upon by various writers who have given us
glimpses into this realm of thought, but it remained
for the author of <span class="smcap">Justin Morgan, Founder of His
Race</span>, to introduce us to a real character, as an individual,
a horse of tradition, but whose lay is unsung.</p>

<p>Almost forgotten, this horse’s <em>origin was wrapt in
obscurity</em> until recently, yet he became the sire of the
most famous breed of horses in America.</p>

<p>Only those who have lived with horses, as I have—&#8203;out
of doors and in my studio—&#8203;learn to know them as
distinct beings, as varied in their make-up and development
as the human kind, affected by the same laws
and influences that stimulate or smother <em>our</em> mental
growth.</p>

<p>I dare not tell all I know to be true about the intelligence
and sagacity of our horse friends, for fear of
having my balance of mind subjected to doubt; but I
am quite ready to believe all that this author tells us
of equine feelings and faithfulness, for she has been
prompted to relate this little tale of <span class="smcap">Old Justin Morgan</span>
through love and intimate acquaintance with his descendants.</p>

<p>The author’s father was the first to introduce the
Morgan horse into the State of Georgia—&#8203;in 1858—&#8203;when
he purchased the celebrated Enterprise, G.G.G.G.
son of <span class="smcap">Justin Morgan</span>. Later he took out many others—&#8203;all
of whom made his stock farm, Annandale, famous.
</p>

<p>My own inherited associations with Vermont brought
me into relation with Morgan horses in childhood, when
I listened to tales of their wonderful powers of endurance,
strength and intelligence, which maturer years
have never made me doubt.</p>

<p>The early Morgan was the best all-round, general-purpose
horse ever produced. They were highly valued,
and New England breeders—&#8203;especially the Vermonters—&#8203;kept
the blood pure by breeding in parallel lines and
then inbreeding, by which means they established a
fixed type that has and will reproduce itself and maintain
its characteristics for generations.</p>

<p>For a period of sixty years the Vermonters bred
nothing but Morgans, and during the Civil War Vermont
was one of the few places where horses could be
obtained. They proved so efficient for cavalry purposes
that the State was almost stripped of them. It is well
known that the best mounted regiments were on Morgan
horses.</p>

<p>Their reputation was such that after the war the West
Point Academy was furnished with none but Morgans,
until about twenty-five years ago the Western horse has
been supplied as a substitute, greatly to the detriment
of the service.</p>

<p>Following the depletion made in 1861-65 came the
popularity of the Hambletonian horse to lead the Vermonters
into untried experiments of doubtful value. The
result was that, by 1890, the pure Morgan horse was
found to be the exception, and the few breeders who
realized what had been lost began to cherish the remnants
of an almost lost race, and prizes were offered for
the best Morgans.</p>

<p>Mr. Joseph Battell, upon whose investigations this
author has founded her historic narrative of the first
Morgan horse, gathered with infinite pains all the pedigrees

he could find and established The Morgan Horse
Register, which is now accepted as the authority.</p>

<p>In 1907 the Morgan horse-breeding work of the
United States Government received a great impetus
when Mr. Battell presented to the Department of Agriculture
four hundred acres of fine land lying two miles
from Middlebury, Vermont, now known as the Morgan
Horse Farm, and equipped with farmhouse, stables,
barns, etc., to which were removed all the horses from
the Vermont Agricultural Experimental Station, near
Burlington.</p>

<p>The Morgan horse has always been noted for his
longevity, retaining his spirit and vigor in extreme old
age. They are free from almost every species of disease,
showing their soundness of constitution. They mature
early, and are easily kept, because they are very
hardy. To-day they show the traits of <span class="smcap">Old Justin
Morgan</span> in their docility and symmetry of form, and
this Founder of his race, according to Mr. Battell, was
but six generations of English breeding from the original
Arab stock, including Byerly Turk and Godolphin
Arabian.</p>

<p>The Morgan horse has quietly won all the honors a
grateful people can bestow upon him, and we are glad to
greet his embodiment of character in this form.</p>

<h3>EARLY INFLUENCES.</h3>


<p>Once upon a time—&#8203;but why should I begin this horse-tale
as if it were a mere fairy-tale? It is founded on
the story of a real horse in a setting of incidents related
in the histories of the various localities in which he lived.
Where possible, history has been so closely followed as
to use the real names of those vigorous pioneers who
helped to make it.</p>

<p>And so, upon a <em>certain</em> <span class="lock">time—</span></p>

<p>In 1789,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> when there were but thirteen stars on the
American flag, and George Washington was the newly-made
President, near Springfield, Massachusetts, a colt
was born, a colt destined to become the founder of the
finest breed of horses ever known in America.</p>

<p>A wide, lush pasture on the gently-sloping bottom
land, through which the Connecticut River winds its
way to the Sound, was the scene of his earliest gambolling.
</p>

<p>Poised at a dizzy height, on wobbly, spindly legs,
which showed little promise of the symmetry and beauty
of later years, he romped near his mother’s protecting
heels or rested in her shadow.</p>

<p>His merry, laughing companion was a brook which
flowed down to the river; he played along its willow-fringed
banks, racing with the beckoning waters until
out of breath; then, hurrying back to his mother through
the gathering dusk, he would return with her to their
pleasant stable in the barnyard of Silas Whitman.</p>

<p>His developing colt-nature expanded, day by day, to
the beauties and interests about him. He loved the
twinkling waters, the overhanging trees, the ferns
spiralling among dark-green shadows; the delicate scent
of violets, peeping between moss-covered stones, delighted
his sensitive nostrils. He loved the birds, fluttering
and swaying on boughs and chirping soft, sweet
notes. In response to all Nature his small-pointed ears
pricked and quivered. He blew his warm breath for fun
on butterflies and bees, as they fussed over dew-wet blossoms,
but swerved aside, with trembling nostrils, at the
strident cry of a jay, waiting in the shadow for <em>his</em>
chance of a practical joke!</p>

<p>The hoot of an owl, the bark of a fox, the crashing
of a squirrel through the branches overhead, would make
him scamper to his mother’s side, panting and excited.</p>

<p>These were his baby fears; his real and lasting antipathy
was to dogs; the distant howling of one seemed to
fill him with terror; thunderstorms, too, made him nervous
and, so impressible was he to these, he could tell,
two days in advance, that one was coming; only much
urging could prevail upon him to leave the security of
his stable when he felt the approach of one.</p>

<p>Gradually his mother taught him all that one good,
faithful horse can teach another, not to show fear, not

to shy, not to kick and never to be taken by surprise.
He was happy and care-free then, for he did not have
to wear hard straps, called harness, nor draw heavy
loads, nor wear iron shoes; and his bare, sensitive hoofs
soon learned to tell the difference between safe and dangerous
ground. His sense of smell was singularly acute
and standing close to his mother’s side—&#8203;that she might
better brush the flies from both, with her long, useful
tail—&#8203;he learned to distinguish poisonous from wholesome
weeds.</p>

<p>Master Whitman called him True Briton, 2d, for his
celebrated father, <cite>True Briton</cite>, but the double name was
soon shortened to the very appropriate one of “True.”
And, for convenience, we shall speak of his mother as
Gipsey.</p>

<p>Gipsey was one of those mothers, unknown to history,
but to whose early influence her son possibly owed
much of his success in later life. Sometimes it was necessary
for her to reprove him; she nipped him sharply,
if he were playful at the wrong time, or kicked too
strongly in fun; but she never had to admonish him
twice about anything on account of his remarkable memory.</p>

<p>One day, when she had to correct him, and was conscious
of having lost her temper, she neighed apologetically.</p>

<p>“Alas, my son, I am no better than a woman!”</p>

<p>This was unjust, as True discovered later, for some
of the strongest friendships of his life were for women;
he found them ever generous with maple sugar and the
goodies for which he quickly learned to whinney at their
kitchen windows. They were more appreciative, too,
and did not expect him to perform miracles, as men did
who set him tasks that taxed every nerve and muscle.</p>

<p>Early each morning Silas Whitman came to the barnyard

to play with and train the colt, and from the beginning
the little creature showed marvellous characteristics.</p>

<p>Never did True forget his first sight of Man! At
that time—&#8203;being quite new-come into the world—&#8203;he did
not know the ways of different animals, and thought
Master Whitman very curious as he walked about on his
hind legs! The small colt wondered if he would have
to do the same when he grew older and his spindly legs
grew stronger. He did not fear the friendly man-creature
who played so gently,—&#8203;little by little training him
to obey and afterwards rewarding him with a bit of
maple sugar. A kind word and a pat was always given
to Gipsey, too, and mother and son very soon began to
watch for their master’s coming, giving him welcome,
with little whinneys, and throaty neighs, when they
heard his cheery whistle.</p>

<p>When True’s third molar came he had made the acquaintance
of a halter. Later in life he came to see
that the conveniences of a halter cannot be taught too
early. He found out uses for his, all by himself; one
was that he could manage to throw the rein over hay
that was too high in the rack to reach comfortably, and
thus pull it down to an easy height. His mother thought
this very ingenious and praised him, which pleased the
little fellow very much.</p>

<p>When the first molar of his permanent teeth came he
had been taught all about a bridle and bit—&#8203;things he
never liked but made the best of, as Gipsey told <a id="chg1"></a>him
they were inevitable.</p>

<p>When there were errands in the village Silas would
hitch Gipsey up to the “shay” and allow True to trot
alongside for exercise and experience. He enjoyed
these little jaunts under the giant elms that bordered the

street, carpeted with a patchwork of sifting sunshine and
cool shadow.</p>

<p>Over garden fences he could see green, succulent box-hedges
and one day, when he found a gate open, he
trotted boldly in to get a taste!</p>

<p>Scarcely had <a id="chg2"></a>he begun to nibble when a dog dashed
round the corner of the house, a boy at his heels. When
the latter caught sight of the intruder he gave a whoop
and urged the dog to nip at True’s feet. The colt,
startled, made a quick movement of self-protection with
his hard little heels and struck the dog on the head, effectually
silencing his bark and rolling him over in the
dirt.</p>

<p>A rock hit the colt’s side, but he did not tarry; excitedly,
he plunged out of the open gate and raced down
the road after his mother, now full half mile away. The
odor of box was ever after associated, disagreeably,
with boys and dogs in his mind.</p>

<p>When he related the incident to his friend, Caesar,
the yellow stable cat, the latter purred conviction and
confided that for untold generations dogs had been the
sworn enemies of his family.</p>

<p>“It <em>may</em> be possible for a boy, occasionally, to be polite
and gentle; I do not know,” mewed the cat. “But as
for dogs! Well, you must unsheath your claws and arch
your back on sight!”</p>

<p>Caesar was an independent cat of wide experience and
had travelled and lived in many barns; his opinion,
therefore, had weight with True. One day, whilst rubbing
against the colt’s leg, in his affectionate way, he
remarked that if it had not been for Gipsey and True
he would long since have returned to his last barn-home,
where the mice had a sweeter flavor on account of a
careless housewife who often left her cheese-box open.</p>

<p>“Besides,” he added, strutting about and waving his

tail with careless dignity, “there is a very nice tortoiseshell
pussy waiting there for me!”</p>

<p>“But, do you know the way back?” asked True, interested
and not failing to admire, and be duly impressed,
by Caesar’s swagger and importance.</p>

<p>“I know the way back well enough,” the cat bragged;
but added with disgust, “In very truth, the jade who
put me in the bag forgot to shake the dust out of it;
but such a trifle could not blind <em>me</em>!”</p>

<p>A very happy playground was the Whitman barnyard.
Beside the horses there were two little red-and-white
calves who romped in a way that entertained but
almost drove Caesar crazy. Before them he would flee,
round and round, instead of getting out of their way at
once!</p>

<p>A curly-tailed, twinkling-eyed pig, very fat and funny,
shared their life for a time; but one day he disappeared,
noisily, and never returned.</p>

<p>In those days the memory of the British was fresh
in the minds of all; the War of the Revolution had been
over but a short eight years and the name “Red-Coat”
still had an ominous sound. Gipsey, being an American
mother, taught her son to hate the British and told
him war-tales that made him quiver with patriotism.</p>

<p>One day the colt invented a game which he called
“Chasing the Red-Coat,” and fine fun it was, to be sure!
With one accord the calves and True made Caesar the
“Red-Coat” because he was such a fleet runner! That
Caesar did not think much of the game was obvious as
he dashed wildly at a tree and running up its trunk sat
spluttering at them, his fur on end, his tail straight in
the air.</p>

<p>Being interrupted by Silas,—&#8203;for daily exercise and
practise in the arts of being bitted and led about—&#8203;never
annoyed the colt. The calves and Caesar watched these

performances, furtively, and wondered when their turns
would come; True always told them the fun he had and
took care to mention the subsequent reward of maple
sugar.</p>

<p>For a short time a gentle pigeon came and sat between
the young horse’s ears and cooed, softly, whilst
he munched at his manger. This was agreeable to the
sociable colt, but he was puzzled to notice that the bird
did not like his other friend, the cat. True could see
how tactfully Caesar tried to win the affections of the
pigeon, even reaching out a paw to pat him sometimes.</p>

<p>One day his feathered friend did not come to the
stable at the usual time and when the cat sauntered in
that afternoon, with a look of keen content on his face,
and a feather in his whiskers, True asked if he had seen
the pigeon.</p>

<p>Caesar had not, of course!</p>

<p>He added, however, as he placidly washed the feather
from his face, that “birds often flew away and did not
return!” His expression was so sincere and sympathetic
that the colt was no little comforted.</p>

<p>In spite of this treachery, Caesar was really fond of
True, and brought him, from time to time, tokens of
his affection in the way of delicacies—&#8203;rats and mice he
had caught in his stealthy rounds—&#8203;sometimes a chicken’s
foot or a fish’s head from the kitchen. It was difficult
for True to refuse these cat-dainties without hurting
Caesar’s feelings, until he hit upon the clever expedient
of pulling out a mouthful of delicious fodder
from his rack and offering it in his turn to the cat!</p>

<p>One day the colt boasted to the cat that he “could
see in the dark.”</p>

<p>Caesar purred, contemptuously, washing his face the
while.</p>

<p>“That, my friend,” he said, “is a mere trifle, hardly

worth bragging about! Now, if you could but speak
the human language, then, indeed, would I wave my tail
and meow, ‘Hail, Master!’”</p>

<p>True was abashed, but said:</p>

<p>“Nay, my mother says speech is but a vain and doubtful
good, especially in women!”</p>

<p>To this sally the cat had no reply, both he and Gipsey
had known women better than the yearling True.</p>

<p>One day Silas brought a black lamb to the pasture,
who at once made friends with the colt. The two
romped and played together, much as human children
might. For the timid little creature True came to have
a deep attachment; he liked the feel of the warm little
body against his leg. No doubt they exchanged ideas
about things of interest as they listened to the brook,
singing happily of woods and meadows through which
it had run on its way to the river.</p>

<p>This sweet friendship lasted many days, but it was
destined to end in a tragedy—&#8203;one that must be related
as it bore so directly upon the sudden awakening of some
of the traits in the colt’s character.</p>

<p>On the edge of a near-by forest there was a rude hut
in which dwelt a family of outlaws who lived on their
neighbors and left honest dealing to others. Round
about the countryside it was whispered they were
“Tories,” and Gipsey told True the evil odor borne on
the breeze from that direction was sufficient assurance
that this was so; the outlaws were, indeed, British, and
the wildest crew that ever stole a horse or fired a haystack!</p>

<p>One day, as True stood wrapt in thought beside the
stream, admiring the courage that made it sing as happily
in sunshine as in shadow, on dark days as on bright,
Black Baby, as the lamb was called, came from the
other side of the pasture and rubbed against his leg.

Seeing in a moment that the colt was preoccupied, the
lamb whisked away to wait for the usual whinney of invitation.</p>

<p>The Tory hut showed clear in the morning sunlight
and, absently, a moment later the colt glanced that way.
To his astonishment he saw the youngest boy, a ne’er-do-well
who had stolen pumpkins and apples from his
neighbors all his life, unloose a lean, gaunt dog and
start towards the pasture.</p>

<p>This young fiend was, oddly enough, named William
Howe, quite enough in itself to set an American by
the ears! True recalled in a flash all his mother had
told him of the British General of the same name.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>“How, now,” he thought, “why comes the young robber
this way?”</p>

<p>Black Baby continued to frisk about, trying to divert
True from his serious mood. He sprang into the air and
tossed his little head, cutting all manner of capers, but
the colt did not seem inclined to join him in play.</p>

<p>William Howe climbed to the top of the stone fence
and, balancing himself adroitly, gazed around as if to
locate any possible mischief.</p>

<p>The dog sprang nimbly over and, yelping, ran after
an innocent rabbit that bounded across the pasture like
an India rubber ball, his short pennant making an almost
unbroken line of white over the green grass as he
fled before his enemy. Luckily he reached the opposite
fence in time and darted behind the protecting stones;
baffled, the dog stood barking, furiously.</p>

<p>Soon the boy put his fingers in his lips and whistled,
shrilly.</p>

<p>Time and again True had warned Black Baby of this
very dog, but the lamb, having known only love and

kindness all his little life, forgot, and frolicked gaily towards
him!</p>

<p>William Howe cried out in delight, “Sick him, Cornwallis!”</p>

<p>The cosset lamb stood an easy mark for the dog and
in an instant lay gasping on the ground, the blood flowing
from a horrid wound in his throat. His sobbing
breath found an echo in True’s heart and for the first
time the colt lost control of himself.</p>

<p>Overcome with a thirst for vengeance, and, screaming
as only a horse does when the strait is desperate, he
plunged and reared. With a well-aimed blow of his hard,
very dark, front-feet he knocked the dog senseless.</p>

<p>This did not satisfy the lamb’s champion; he stamped
the body of the wicked beast into the earth, crushing
bones as if they had been straws! Furiously he bit, and
finally caught the limp carcass in his strong teeth and
threw it high in the air. For the moment he was a
demon and sought, savagely, for more ways to wipe
the remains out of existence!</p>

<p>Suddenly he remembered William Howe who stood at
a distance, pelting him with stones. Uttering another
fierce cry he turned upon the boy, baring his teeth
hideously between his firm lips.</p>

<p>Howe made for the fence, where the desperate rabbit
had sought cover, and scrambled over, thinking to be
safe on the other side; he did not know the colt was
descended from the “birds of the desert!”</p>

<p>True was not even <em>aware</em> of a barrier! As if he had
wings he soared over it, doubling his hind-feet close
under his body a little to one side.</p>

<p>A tree was all that saved the boy’s life. Swinging up
by a low-hanging branch, with the agility of a cat, he
found himself out of breath and out of reach of the
colt’s gleaming teeth. From wide, scarlet nostrils the

hot and excited breath of the maddened animal reached
his bare feet.</p>

<p>The Tory scent that came down to True only increased
his anger, but not being able to reach the boy,
he resolved that the kicking he owed him could be postponed—&#8203;for
years, if necessary—&#8203;but some day, <em>some day</em>,
it would be delivered! Furthermore—&#8203;he would kick
nothing until that day arrived and he met this boy again
on level ground!</p>

<p>How he kept his vow we shall see later.</p>

<h3>TRUE IS BROKEN TO HARNESS.</h3>


<p>Even, pleasant and cheerful was True’s natural disposition,
but besides these traits there were others that
went to make up the peculiar perfection horse-flesh had
attained in the twenty-five years before his birth.</p>

<p>A courage, vitality, and zest seemed to be in the very
air of the world at that period of horse history, and the
blend—&#8203;through his father—&#8203;of Arabian, Barb and Turk
had produced in him the most ideal of horse characters.</p>

<p>That Southern strain was, no doubt, stimulated by
the clear, bracing climate of New England, and the combination
of circumstances which developed his muscles
and expanded his chest, made him the fit founder of a
race.</p>

<p>About the year he was born Eclipse, his kins-horse,
died.</p>

<p>Eclipse was that four-footed bird “behind whom the
whirlwind toiled in vain” and who, in his greatest race,
“beat the other horse by two hundred yards, without
urging!”<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>Since then men have said that Eclipse ran “a mile a
minute,” but Gipsey told her son differently; she knew
horses only ran against each other, not against time.</p>

<p>She also told the colt the part his family had played
in the late War, and how General Washington, himself,
had ridden one of them at Trenton; but she was obliged

to confess, with a droop of her spirited tail, that his
father, True Briton had, in his youth, served a British
officer.</p>

<p>So graphic were some of these war-tales that the young
horse quivered, and almost imagined he heard the crack
of muskets and smelt the smoke of battle! He dreamed
longingly of a time when he, too, might serve his country
under the saddle of some brave soldier, and his nostrils
grew wide and his eyes fiery at the hope which
was so long afterwards to be realized.</p>

<p>Had she been a woman, and men had seen the workings
of her mind as she instructed her son, Gipsey might
have been called a witch and as such been burned. With
pointing ears and ember-like eyes she neighed softly to
him of the Desert; she seemed to hear its call; to see its
trackless wastes, and afar, at its limits, she told him
groves of olive and date, and pools of clear, cool water
lay.</p>

<p>One day, with that far-off look in her eyes, she said to
him, prophetically:</p>

<p>“When other horses, now famous, are forgotten, my
son, your memory will live on, your influence will still
be felt. Men will still love you and you will be praised
and revered by all who have knowledge of excellence in
horse-flesh. A state will be noted for its horses, and
Allah has chosen you to be the first of this line.”</p>

<p>She told him to be ever brave, gentle, and loving;
obedient to his master, Man; not to falter, not to turn
back never mind the cost.</p>

<p>She told him how to anticipate a command, that he
might obey, instantly, and he afterwards became so proficient
in this sense that when he came to be trained to
harness he obeyed Silas Whitman’s every gesture, as if
instinctively, often before the words themselves came.

In later life, becoming more experienced, he often took
the initiative in times of danger or peril.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p>When True was a little over a year old Master Whitman
brought a piebald horse to live in their stable. Poor
old Ceph was of low birth and very stupid.</p>

<p>“In the Desert,” Gipsey told him, “the Arabs say, ‘if
piebald, flee him as the pestilence, for he is own brother
to a cow’!”</p>

<p>Ceph turned out to be a “stump-sucker” or “piper,”
and the grunts and groans accompanying his gnawing
disturbed the other two horses intensely. At last when
he began on the partition between his stall and True’s
it was too much for the colt to bear in silence and patience.
He determined to cure him in some way, though
at first he did not see how it was to be done.</p>

<p>One day, however, a bit of chain was left hanging
on his manger and, when he pushed it with his nose, it
made a jangling noise. Ceph, always curious, stopped
his “cribbing” long enough to listen, dully, with his flapping
ears, and to wonder what it was.</p>

<p>After a short time True found, to his surprise and
satisfaction, that he could lift the chain with his teeth
and, as he was now tall enough for his chin to reach

the top of the partition, it occurred to him he could use
the bit of iron to very good advantage.</p>

<p>He laid his plans accordingly and bade Caesar be on
hand to see the fun.</p>

<p>About midnight Ceph began to gnaw.</p>

<p>Quick as wink True had the chain in his teeth and
over the wall it went—&#8203;crack—&#8203;right between Ceph’s
floppy ears!</p>

<p>Such amazement there never was in any dull horse’s
quiet, stupid mind! He squealed and sprang one side,
startled into anger and affright. But when he recovered
himself all was still; no suspicious noises came from his
neighbor’s stall.</p>

<p>Caesar had been standing on his hind legs, peeping
through a hole in the partition and at sight of Ceph’s
bewilderment, he rolled over in a paroxysm of mirth, as
if he did not have a bone in his body, while True stood
motionless, guarding their secret.</p>

<p>Presently, very cautiously, Ceph began to gnaw again
on the wood of his manger.</p>

<p>In his haste to give another lick, True nearly stepped
on the prostrate cat, but, holding his foot poised a moment,
Caesar sprang lightly from under it just as a
mighty swing took the chain over the barrier.</p>

<p>Ceph threw his head into the air, indignantly, but his
suspicions were unconfirmed the silence next door was
so intense; then, to add to his perplexity, he heard Gipsey
wake with a groan and a stamp.</p>

<p>“Will we never get any rest!” she neighed, hopelessly.</p>

<p>True whinneyed softly, over her side of his stable, to
be of good cheer, the worst was over. And afterwards
the least sound from Ceph brought a rattling of the
mysterious chain which had struck him so hard on the
head.
</p>

<p>For a few nights this went on, but finally success
crowned the colt’s efforts and much to the satisfaction
of all, Silas included, Ceph stopped gnawing.</p>

<p>This was not the only time True showed ingenuity.
He learned many useful though not mischievous tricks
all by himself, but it is not to be supposed that Silas
thought as much of them as Gipsey. The colt discovered
how to open all the gates, but, as he never thought
to close them, their barn-companions wandered out and
never returned without being sent for though the horses
always came home in good temper after their wanderings
in time for the evening meal. At last locks and
keys were put on everything, and this was the first intimation
True had that his pleasant little accomplishment
was not appreciated by his master. As he grew
older he eliminated the unpopular trick from his list.</p>

<p>One day, being thirsty, he began to consider how he
could open the rain barrel, in which Mistress Whitman
caught water for her washing. He tried hard to push
the cover <a id="chg3">to</a> one side, but some clever human contrivance
made it catch, and so, after trying several other ways,
he found the simple and right one of catching the handle
in his strong young teeth and lifting straight upward!</p>

<p>Sometimes when he had done this and drunk all the
water he wanted, he would pick the cat up by the scruff
of the neck with his teeth and hold him over the barrel,
meowing desperately, for of all things Caesar hated
water! True was only teasing him, but the cat never
knew that, and a spasm of terror would chill his marrow
at thought of being dropped in.</p>

<p>The death of Black Baby made True more serious and
earnest. He went about his daily tasks with interest
and spirit, but he did not romp so much and listened
more attentively to his mother’s teachings.
</p>

<p>One day he found himself hitched up in harness with
old Piebald, Ceph. Silas had thought Gipsey too spirited
to begin him with, but True walked so fast, and—&#8203;though
very unsteadily at first—&#8203;trotted so much faster than his
mate that the next day he was taken out with his mother.</p>

<p>From her he had learned the Royal Road to Happiness
and Success: “Obedience first, last, and all the
time!”</p>

<p>It was, indeed, a proud day for the colt.</p>

<p>Easy it was for a horse to obey Silas Whitman, he
was so careful to explain, and to be sure they understood;
he never let them get fretted trying to find out
what he wanted by themselves.</p>

<p>As soon as True found he was not expected to run or
gallop in harness, he settled down to walking or trotting
in his nervous brisk way, and soon the gaits of mother
and son were evenly matched.</p>

<p>As time increased True became more and more lovable
and people came for miles to see him; some even
wanted to buy him and offered as much as twenty-five
dollars. But Silas refused all offers for his pet. Very
soon he was hitched to the “shay” alone. He stepped
out bravely enough feeling the friendly hand of his master
to advise and guide him. Then again he had a turn
under the saddle; this was freer for there were not so
many rules to remember!</p>

<p>When they went on trips of the latter kind, Silas,
who was a very well-informed man, talked to him and
told him many interesting things and gave him much
instruction. Sometimes, on their way home over open
fields, grassy knolls and wooded hillsides, Silas would
take the wrong turning and leave True to find out the
right way by himself. That strange sense of direction
in horses was singularly acute in True and they invariably

reached home safely, the horse enjoying this confidence
of his rider.</p>

<p>One sunny day when the little horse was nearly two
years old, they were returning from a trip up the river
when Silas swooned, it was a sickness to which he was
subject, and, slipping from the saddle to the road, he
rolled into the ditch. True, no little disturbed, stood
thoughtful a moment, wondering what he could do for
his unconscious friend. Finally he caught hold of the
Continental collar with his teeth and drew him gently
up on the grassy border of the road, under the shade of
an oak. Looking around he whinneyed for help, but,
as no answer came, he turned and galloped homeward,
nor did he go by the longer way of the road. Over
rough, uneven, cleared spaces, he went; stone fences
stretched across his way; here and there strips of dense
woods interfered with but did not retard his speed or
intention.</p>

<p>When he neared the house a curl of blue smoke told
him where he would find Mistress Whitman, nor was he
mistaken. He trotted straight to the kitchen window
at which he was wont to receive goodies from her generous
hands; there she stood, slender and womanish, beside
a pot of soup, hanging on the crane, whose warm
fragrance permeated the air.</p>

<p>True whinneyed sharply. She looked up, and, seeing
the empty saddle, started with anxiety and hastened
out. The horse rubbed his nose on her sleeve and
neighed his message, softly.</p>

<p>She seemed to understand the horse-language at once
and, leading him to the horse-block, climbed into the saddle
without delay.</p>

<p>And this was True’s first experience of carrying a
lady! She was so light of weight, and she spoke to
him so fearlessly, that he drew much comfort through

his bridle-rein. He started off at an even canter not
hesitating at his stable door, though it must have been
hard to pass the appetizing sound of Gipsey and Ceph
munching at their supper.</p>

<p>This time he took the road, in a long smooth gait,
and after a short time reached the strip of woods where
Silas had been left.</p>

<p>Master Whitman, thin and very bright of eye, was
sitting up now, and seemed much better, so his good
wife aided him to mount the horse and climbed up behind
him; thus they set out toward home, and True had
his first experience of “carrying double.”</p>

<p>What a supper the “pony” had that night!</p>

<p>Oats, dry as pease, corn and carrots, a little flaxseed
jelly, and chopped hay springled with salt.</p>

<p>’Twas a supper fit for Eclipse, himself!</p>

<h3>CEPH’S UNHAPPY FATE.</h3>


<p>Never had Ceph been treated kindly by anyone; he’d
never had “half a chance in life,” as Gipsey said. Nobody
ever praised him, everybody blamed him, and he
had nothing but blows and hard words for his portion.
Even his food, which always came irregularly, had to
be gobbled, for fear time enough to eat it comfortably
would not be given him! Nobody ever rubbed him down
when he was hot and tired, and his work was harder and
more exacting than that of the other two.</p>

<p>For the most part he took it philosophically, with only
an occasional groan until, perhaps, he saw better food
measured out for his neighbors than was measured out
for him, then he stamped and grunted and sometimes bit
at them, crossly.</p>

<p>For many years he had been subject to spavin, at times
his hock swelled badly and he went lame and limped
painfully. At last Silas could close his eyes no longer
to the fact that unless something were done for the old
horse he would become entirely useless.</p>

<p>In Springfield a horse doctor lived who knew, among
other things, how to “fire” a spavined hock. True had
once seen this man thrust a sharp knife into a horse’s
mouth who had lampers; the flow of warm red blood had
made the colt shudder and, remembering this, he was
very sorry when he found out this cruel person was to
visit Ceph.</p>

<p>Gipsey recalled that this Dr. Quack had once been

sent for to see a neighbor’s suffering cow; he arrived,
looking wise and solemn, and declared the cow had a
disease called “hollow-horn.” He thereupon split her
tail lengthwise and filled the raw opening with salt and
pepper.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>The poor cow died, and none but her barn-mates knew
the distressing fact that she had really died of “hollow
stomach,” not “hollow horn,” because their owner was so
cruelly economical with food!</p>

<p>It was with no little sorrow that True recognized the
coarse, rasping voice of the “doctor” when he came to
see Ceph late one evening.</p>

<p>Through a crack in their darkening stalls True espied
the red-hot crow-bar, and the guttering tallow dip Silas
had lighted and brought from the kitchen.</p>

<p>Piebald Ceph had always been a mild-tempered horse,
but scarce had the firing-iron touched his hock than he
sent it—&#8203;and the candle—&#8203;flying into the hayloft, with an
unexpected and well-directed kick.</p>

<p>Before a horse could have whinneyed the place was in
flames, the dry hay dropping in blazing bunches from
overhead.</p>

<p>A diabolic scene followed!</p>

<p>Seconds passed like hours.</p>

<p>True jerked his halter loose in terror, snapping the
rope sharply; his heart almost ceased to beat, he was so
frightened. Gipsey, locked in her stall, uttered a scream,
as horses sometimes do when overcome with fear: old
Ceph, crowding into the extreme corner of his stable,
groaned pitifully.</p>

<p>It was like a roaring furnace, the heat intense, the
smoke suffocating.</p>

<p>The shouting of the men was drowned in the confused
mingling of horrible sounds as the flames leaped

and licked the dry hay and caught the well-seasoned timbers.</p>

<p>The horrid odor of burnt hair, a sudden silence in
Ceph’s stall, told a heart-rending tale. The echoes of
his mother’s cry had hardly died away when True felt
a cool, wet cloth thrown over his eyes and held tightly;
something struck him violently, and a voice spoke to him
in such a tone of command that he forgot everything and,
trembling like a leaf, allowed himself to be led into the
outer air.</p>

<p>Then, vaguely at first, he recognized Mistress Whitman’s
tones, soothing now, and tender, albeit very shaky!</p>

<p>“Come, my little pet, there’s naught to fear now!”</p>

<p>And, trusting her, the colt followed tractably enough
as she led him up two stone steps into the kitchen and
took the bandage from his eyes.</p>

<p>Then she hurried out, closing the door tight.</p>

<p>An awful crash, a sudden greater roar, then ominous
silence—&#8203;the barn roof had fallen in!</p>

<p>“Alas, my poor mother!” groaned True.</p>

<p>The rattling of a tin pan at his side made him turn;
to his everlasting joy he saw Gipsey, safe and sound as
himself, shut up in the kitchen.</p>

<p>Gipsey was an excitable mare, and began to prance
about the place in an unseemly way, switching kettles
and pewter pots off the table with her nervous tail and
knocking them to the floor with a monstrous racket.</p>

<p>Finally she pushed the cover from the swinging pot
on the crane. Luckily the fire had been out some time
and the delicious contents of the pot barely warm, else
she would have had her nose burned. The odor of the
mash proved very enticing and she was greedily, or maybe
thoughtlessly, about to drink it all, when True pushed
her one side, as if to remind her of her manners, and

finished it himself—&#8203;little dreaming, either one of them,
it was the Whitman’s frugal supper.</p>

<p>During their feast the uproar outside had subsided,
and in a little while Silas and his wife came in, saying it
was all over with poor old Ceph.</p>

<p>The noses of the two rescued horses were gray and
greasy with the rich mash, but in the thankfulness of
their escape the Whitmans cared nothing for that. Mistress
Whitman put her cheek against True’s soupy face
and sobbed in a very womanish way for joy at his being
spared to them.</p>

<p>The young horse submitted patiently to her caresses,
though her hair, looking like dry, crisp hay, smelled mortally
of smoke; he saw it was a comfort to her woman-heart
to hang about his neck and murmur softly in his
ear:</p>

<p>“True, dear little horse,” she whispered. “It doesn’t
matter about Ceph.”</p>

<p>“There it is again,” thought True. “Nobody cares
whether poor old Ceph is burnt up or not.”</p>

<p>And nobody did, as long as Gipsey and he were saved.</p>

<h3>JUSTIN MORGAN.</h3>


<p>In True’s third year, Master Whitman came one morning,
betimes, to brush him down before taking him out
for his usual exercise—&#8203;so the “pony” thought. But
after a while he was convinced that his master called
him names more loving and tender than usual and that
his voice had a sorrowful ring.</p>

<p>Gipsey and True knew that hard times had come knocking
at the farm-gate and that their kind master was in
debt because his crops had failed the year before. They
knew, too, if the worst came to the worst they might
have to be sold to pay these debts.</p>

<p>On this particular morning Master Whitman murmured
sadly to his pet as he continued to polish the sides
of his symmetrical body until they shone like the bosom
of the river when the afternoon sunlight played upon
it; and his heavy mane and tail were brushed until they
waved lightly under every passing breeze.</p>

<p>With unfailing intuition the colt saw the future: their
happy home, alas, was about to be broken up. Even
Caesar felt the prevailing gloom; dejectedly, he sat on a
beam and washed his face for the fifth time that morning,
though it was but just sunrise.</p>

<p>Gipsey peered over the partition of their stall and
whinneyed softly, but with resignation, for, wise old
horse that she was, she knew it was the lot of horses to
be parted, sooner or later—&#8203;here to-day, there to-morrow.</p>

<p>Presently the cat sprang nimbly down, and arching

his back, rubbed himself against his master’s leg and
purred with sympathy.</p>

<p>In spite of a certain sadness, True himself felt no little
excitement—&#8203;anticipating adventure, as is the manner of
youth first starting out into the great world. He did
not then know the horrors of homesickness from which
affectionate horses suffer so keenly—&#8203;suffering that neither
sugar nor salt can assuage.</p>

<p>Master Whitman had always made play and pleasure
of training, and had never given True a task he could
not perform. For this reason the horse accepted every
order unhesitatingly, with the confidence of absolute
trust. They had become so endeared to one another for
these and sundry other causes that the idea of a parting
was inexpressibly saddening to both.</p>

<p>When, a half hour later, True was hitched to the
“shay”—&#8203;which he now pulled with such ease and pleasure—&#8203;he
fared forth, sad at heart, but eager and brisk in
gait, as usual. The day had advanced and, as they travelled,
the river glinted gold in the light which the morning
sun threw over the fringe of trees along its banks.
Very soon they arrived at the tavern where already
several teams stood waiting.</p>

<p>Throwing the reins loosely on the horse’s back—&#8203;for he
had been trained to stand without hitching—&#8203;Silas Whitman
sprang from the “shay” and entered the tavern.</p>

<p>He was gone the best part of an hour, and when he
returned he was not alone. A tall, slender stranger
walked beside him, and as they drew near the colt perceived
from the odor of this man that he was a pleasant-tempered
person and friendly to animals.</p>

<p>Indeed, True liked him at once, and ’twas well, for the
pale, scholarly looking man whose name he would one
day bear, was none other than <cite>Justin Morgan</cite>, who had

once lived in Springfield, but had moved to Randolph,
Vermont, in 1788, with his family.</p>

<p>As Master Morgan pressed the muscles of the young
horse the latter did not flinch nor draw away. Then the
mouth had to be examined and the feet looked at, one
by one. Questions had to be answered and other investigations
made, common among men engaged in a
horse deal.</p>

<p>Master Whitman answered the questions, or stood in
grave silence, his eyes moist with the tears he could
not entirely hide, as his acquaintance considered True’s
various traits.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir,” the stranger finally said, “this colt, as you
say, is free from natural blemish and is not disfigured
by that cruel, prevailing practice of branding. He seems
sound…. You say he is the son of De Lancey’s True
Briton, and his mother a descendant of the Layton
Barb?”</p>

<p>“I repeat it,” replied Silas Whitman, “<em>these are the
facts, to the best of my belief</em>.”</p>

<p>He could scarcely trust himself to speak.</p>

<p>“He is remarkably well ribbed-up and firm under the
mane, for so young a horse,” said Master Morgan, “but
he is small.”</p>

<p>“He is not yet entirely developed,” was the answer.
“You see, he is, as yet, scarce three years old. But he
is a bit over fourteen hands, and weighs already upwards
of nine hundred pounds. I told you he might be called
a pony, except for his characteristics.”</p>

<p>“No doubt he will increase in weight, and maybe a bit
in height,” Master Morgan agreed. “His Arabian ancestry
would account for his size. Not that I am one
of those foolish persons who considers size necessary for
<em>perfection</em>,” he hastily added. “Since I have seen him
I am willing to take him in place of the twenty-five dollars

you owe me, though twenty-five dollars is a large
sum, and I am a poor man. Shall we call it settled?”</p>

<p>For a moment True thought his old master would
surely have one of his spells of faintness, but when he
finally spoke his voice was brave and steady.</p>

<p>“The pony,” he said, gently, “will be ready for you in
the morning.” He rested his arm across True’s neck,
while the stranger looked away for a moment. “This
little horse,” Silas continued, after a pause, having recovered
himself, “has been to me what the ‘steed of the
desert’ is to his Arab master. When I part with him
I give you the best friendship I ever had; the best work
of three years, spent in training and developing the intelligence
of this remarkable horse. And, mark you, he
will live to bear out the confidence I have in him. I
have ever treated him as a human being; I have romped
with him, played with him, talked to him as I might have
talked to a child—&#8203;if Providence had blessed my wife
and me with such a treasure—&#8203;but I have ever insisted
upon <em>obedience</em> and <em>respect</em>, as a father should insist upon
these qualities from a child.”</p>

<p>“As I insist upon in mine,” acquiesced Master Morgan,
as Silas hesitated a moment, feeling he was perhaps
saying too much.</p>

<p>“There is but one thing more I would add,” went on
Silas, feeling a friendly sympathy from Master Morgan.
“Be good to him and he will be faithful to you, teach
him to love you and his willing service will be to you and
yours until the end. He does not know what falter
means, and if you are wise you will never let him find
out by asking him to do impossible things. Ask of
him only that which is within his power and he will
never fail you.”</p>

<p>Kind-hearted Master Morgan grasped Whitman’s
hand. “I shall not forget,” he said, deeply touched.
</p>

<p>That night Caesar climbed on the rack of True’s stall
and dropped lightly down on the horse’s back, where he
purred an undying affection and sorrow at his friend’s
approaching departure. Hoping to cheer him a little,
the cat told many anecdotes of other stables and barns
which he suggested True might some time visit, but the
heavy sadness could not be lifted from their hearts. Gipsey
gave him advice, and at midnight Master Whitman
came to see if all were well with his pet. At cock-crow
Mistress Whitman appeared with a most delicious breakfast
as a parting favor.</p>

<p>Silas had just finished rubbing the young horse down
when his new owner came, bringing his own saddle and
bridle—&#8203;and very easy and comfortable they were, too.</p>

<p>When the sad partings were over, True stepped fearlessly
out on his way to the broad highway of the world,
where he was to have so many sweet and bitter experiences.

<h3>TRUE MEETS HIS FATHER.</h3>


<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“‘Oh, ’twas a joyful sound to hear,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Our tribes devoutly say,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Up Israel, to the Temple haste,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">And keep your festal day!’”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>It was Justin Morgan, singing his favorite hymn, in
his light tenor voice, and True pointed his ears to better
hear the agreeable sound.</p>

<p>Master Morgan was not a strong man physically, and
his ways were those of a scholar and student, but he was
lovable and staunch and true, and, lilting the stave of
“Mear” he set out on the road to the southward.</p>

<p>Along the bank of the tranquil river stretched the
highway to Hartford, and it was Master Morgan’s plan
to exhibit his new horse at the great fair so soon to be
held in that fine city.</p>

<p>It was near sunset when they arrived, and True stepped
out so smartly, and Justin Morgan, being a great rider,
the people paused in the streets to admire them, as they
cantered easily on to the public stable to rest and refresh
themselves.</p>

<p>True’s name was now changed to “Figure,” the name
once borne by a famous horse, dead some years since;
and under this name he came to be known through the
columns of that very respected paper, <cite>The Hartford
Courant</cite>.</p>

<p>“Next to his own father, sir,” True heard the hostler
say, as he led him into a stall and snapped the catch of
the halter into the ring. “Now what do you think of

that? The horse in the next box, sir, is Mr. Selah Norton’s
Beautiful Bay, him that was True Briton.”</p>

<p>Master Morgan looked in at the splendid animal and
said, “Oh, the De Lancey horse, eh? A fine fellow he is
still, I see, in spite of his age. Well, all I can say is,
mine is the ‘worthy son of a worthy sire’!”</p>

<p>True quivered. Already the great world was offering
adventure and reward. Crowding through his veins
the fire of his father’s race throbbed and surged, his
mane shook and he flicked his waving tail with eager anticipation.
His alert ears pointed back and forth with
attention, his eyes glowed and his wide nostrils trembled
as he inhaled the scent of his father for the first time.
Proud and vigorous, he pawed the floor to attract Beautiful
Bay; now and then he glanced with feigned carelessness
through a wide crack.</p>

<p>Full soon he was rewarded by a sight of the gleaming
eye of his neighbor at the same aperture.</p>

<p>For a moment they gazed in silence; then True took a
step forward, and raising his nose to the top of the partition
met the firm tip of his father’s.</p>

<p>Without further demonstration an affection sprang up
between the two.</p>

<p>In the course of time the hostler came to lead the new
horse out, in the deepening twilight, to show him to
some visitors. The interest True took in the performance,
one could be reasonably certain, was not on account
of the visitors, but because he was well aware of his
splendid father’s interest and admiration.</p>

<p>That night when all was quiet the old war-horse said:</p>

<p>“You are like your mother, my son, I remember her
well—&#8203;and a fine, noble mare she was, to be sure. Her
hoof beat music from the path and she struck the road
with the same nervous tread that I see you have—&#8203;as a
pigeon in full career repulses the air. She scoffed at

hills and mounted them with a dash of spirited flight, as
if she joyed in their difficulties.”</p>

<p>True recalled his mother’s admiration of his father,
and his heart beat gratefully at these words. He, too,
remembered Gipsey’s poetic motion, her rhythmic step, as
if she trod an even melody, and her willingness to take
a hill.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“As his name is, so is he,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">If you believe not, come and see!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>So <cite>The Hartford Courant</cite> described Beautiful Bay, and
the rhyme was a by-word about the town—&#8203;for they were
very proud of Beautiful Bay in Hartford. It was not
long before True heard the couplet in the stables, and
right proud was he to be the son of so praised a father.</p>

<p>Beautiful Bay told True many stirring tales in the
quiet nights they spent so close together, for the older
horse had ever been a “soldier of Fortune” and his life
one of constant change and excitement.</p>

<p>It was a great boast for a horse to say he had been
bred in the De Lancey stables, for those De Lanceys,
like Mahommed, had been lovers of horses, and their
stables and half-mile running track, in the centre of what
was so soon to be the very heart of the great city of
New York, was the finest in the Northern Colonies before
the War of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Gay blades were those De Lanceys, and their rightful
inheritance was the sporting blood of old England, though
they were, after all, part Huguenot, part Dutch, by ancestry.</p>

<p>Colonel De Lancey, True Briton’s first owner, had married
a Mistress Van Courtlandt, whose family had a King
and a Bishop at their backs, and occupied half the important
posts under the crown. He was a rollicking,
generous, reckless gentleman, at home alike in drawing room

or on the course, but when, through stress of circumstances,
this British officer had to change his mode of
living, there was a sale of his horses at John Fowler’s
Tavern, near the Tea-Water Pump, in Bowery Lane.
All the favorites went but his especial saddle horse, True
Briton—&#8203;who now frankly admitted to his son his worth
and beauty in those days. Indeed, he seemed to have no
<em>false modesty</em> about it at all, and confessed his superiority
over all his stable-mates, even though among them there
were such horses as Lath and Slamerkin.</p>

<p>According to the accounts of the old horse his youth
had been spent in a time the like of which True could
never see. He told of the gaily dressed dandies—&#8203;waiting
on ladies in silks and satins and waving plumes—&#8203;at
the meets; of the sudden seal of disapproval Congress
had put upon the dissipations and extravagances of the
race-course; of how the Annapolis Jockey Club had set
the foolish fashion of economy by closing its course; of
how the grass grew up in the one-time splendid Centre
Course at Philadelphia.</p>

<p>But of all his anecdotes the tale of how True Briton
became a true Patriot interested the young horse most,
and ran in this wise:</p>

<p>Colonel De Lancey was stationed at Westchester with
his regiment, which was known far and wide as “The
Cow-Boys,” because they stole cattle from the “Skinners”
(a name given the farmers at that time).</p>

<p>At last the latter resolved to appeal to the Colonel-in-command
for a protection of their rights and property.
Accordingly, “Skinner Smith” called upon Colonel De
Lancey, a white handkerchief tied to a stick, to show a
peaceful errand, and made complaint of the depredations
of the “Cow-Boys.”</p>

<p>Now the Colonel, ever cool and gay, as became a De
Lancey, cried out with a great laugh:
</p>

<p>“These be the chances of war, my lack-beard. If my
good soldiers need cattle, or food of other kind, and you
will not give it to them, egad! they must steal it! Best
curb your uncouth tongue and be gone!”</p>

<p>“Then, by my lack of beard!” quoth Skinner Smith,
nettled—&#8203;he was an impudent young scamp, and feared no
one—&#8203;“‘What is sauce for the goose, is sauce for the
gander!’ If these be the ‘chances of war,’ look well to
that fine horse of yours! I warn you fairly, others can
be cattle stealers, too! I warn you fairly—&#8203;and now
wish you a very good day.”</p>

<p>It chanced that under cover of darkness one night,
shortly afterward, Colonel De Lancey rode to see his
mother at some distance and left True Briton hitched
at the door-step.</p>

<p>Young Smith, waiting his “chance of war,” sprang
from behind a tree as the door of the house closed, unhitched
the horse, leaped into the saddle and plunging
spurs into True Briton’s sides—&#8203;who, wide of eye and red-nostrilled,
sprang forward—&#8203;did not draw rein until he was
well within the American lines.</p>

<p>The amazed and disgusted Colonel raised an alarm and
roused his orderlies, but too late. He never saw his
favorite again until one fine day he found himself incarcerated
in the jail at Hartford with many another
“Red-Coat.”</p>

<p>Beautiful Bay, then in the possession of Mr. Selah
Norton, was standing in front of Bull’s Tavern, across
Meeting House Green.</p>

<p>“Blood will tell, in men as well as horses,” finished
Beautiful Bay. “When Colonel De Lancey recognized
me he threw me a laughing greeting and a wave of the
hand. I could almost hear what his parted lips were
saying: ‘The chance of war, my friend!’”

<h3>TRUE GAZES UPON MISTRESS LLOYD, OF MARYLAND.</h3>


<p>The following day, laughter and talk outside the stable
announced that several persons had come to visit the
horses.</p>

<p>It chanced that among them was that brilliant quartette
of men, known as the “Hartford Wits,” with Master
Trumbull at their head.</p>

<p>The latter stood chatting with a mere slip of a girl,
dark-eyed and merry. In her hand she carried a fine,
thread-lace kerchief—&#8203;like gossamer films at dawn—&#8203;and
a pouf of gauze fell away from her snowy throat. She
wore a perriot of flowered taffeta trimmed with herrisons,
and from beneath her petticoat two little slippered
feet peeped shyly. She was the most radiant being True
had ever seen. Enraptured, he followed her with his
eyes whichever way she turned. For all her beauty, she
was yet strong and fine in her promise of fuller womanhood.
There was a quick certainty about her every movement,
and a steadiness of eye that showed no indeterminate
character.</p>

<p>Near her stood a Coxcomb, filling the air with odors
of musk and powders, offensive to the nostrils of the little
horse who was led past him. A secret loathing for
this popinjay was born in his heart which he never outgrew.</p>

<p>“Ah, Mistress Lloyd,” said the Coxcomb, drawling
his words disagreeably, and waving a scented lace-bordered
handkerchief, “what say you to Beautiful Bay?

Have your kinsmen, Carroll of Carrollton, or the Hon.
Edward Lloyd—&#8203;or, for the matter of that, the dashing
Tom Dulaney—&#8203;anything finer at their country-seats in
Maryland? Is there anything in Virginia, or South
Carolina, to compare with our Beautiful Bay?”</p>

<p>Smiling, the maid stepped in front of Beautiful Bay
and held out a slender pink palm—&#8203;like the petals of wild
roses True had seen on his way from Springfield—&#8203;on it
lay a bit of maple sugar, and right proudly the old horse
arched his neck and ate from her hand, picking up the
crumbs with his firm but flexible lips, that his hard teeth
might not scar the tender flesh.</p>

<p>With her dainty kerchief she flicked his side lightly,
replying evasively:</p>

<p>“We’ve nothing <em>better groomed</em>.” Turning to her
father she cried gaily, “Come hither, Daddy, dear, and
touch his satin coat!”</p>

<p>Beautiful Bay pranced a little to show his appreciation.</p>

<p>“Have a care, my child,” warned her father.</p>

<p>Her laughter rippled forth as she drew Beautiful
Bay’s muzzle down for a caress.</p>

<p>“It would not bite a maiden’s cheek, would it?” she
cooed in his ready ear, and he trembled with joy at the
sound. Young Mistress Lloyd’s “way with horses” was
known from Maryland to Boston.</p>

<p>The Coxcomb flicked his riding boot impatiently with
his whip. This annoyed Beautiful Bay, who, thinking
to please the maid, turned abruptly to him and bared his
teeth, flattening his ears.</p>

<p>The popinjay sprang to one side.</p>

<p>“He can’t abide smells!” explained the hostler, apologetically,
as he led the old horse back into his stable.</p>

<p>And this was the first time that True saw Mistress

Lloyd, of Maryland; though she had taken no notice of
him, he never forgot it.</p>

<p>Deeply attached did the two horses become to each
other, and Old Worldly-Wise taught Young Innocence
much that was afterwards of use to him. He told him of
the city, where men sat, far into the night, and played
cards or other games by the glare of torchlight or wax
candle; of how they danced with or serenaded fair ladies
till cock-crow. It contrasted strangely with True’s former
quiet nights and peaceful days in the Valley of the
Connecticut, but it interested him intensely and awakened
longings within him.</p>

<p>He marvelled to see Beautiful Bay active and spirited
enough at his age to clear a five-barred gate like a greyhound,
and to see his bearing under the saddle alike
youthful and stylish.</p>

<p>The old horse had a fund of anecdotes to impart about
the Desert and its traditions.</p>

<p>“Arabs,” he said, “think it wicked to change their
coursers into beasts of burden and tillage. Why did
Allah make the ox for the plough and the camel to transport
merchandise, if not that the horse was for the race?”</p>

<p>True had no answer ready, so Beautiful Bay continued:</p>

<p>“If you meet one of the Faithful in the Desert mounted
on a <em>kochlani</em>, and he shall say to you, ‘God bless you!’
before you can say, ‘And God’s blessing be upon you!’
he shall be out of sight.”</p>

<p>True learned how to judge a horse by his color through
Arabian tradition.</p>

<p>“White is for princes, but these do not stand the heat;
black brings good fortune, but fears rocky ground; chestnut
is most active—&#8203;if one tells you he has seen a horse
‘fly in the air,’ and the horse be chestnut, believe him!”</p>

<p>There was a pause, during which True anxiously
waited to hear what was said of bays.
</p>

<p>Finally he asked.</p>

<p>“They say,” answered his father, with a certain natural
pride, “that ‘bay is hardiest and best.’ If one tells you
he has seen a horse ‘leap to the bottom of a precipice
without hurting himself,’ and if he say ‘bay,’ believe him!”</p>

<p>And being bay, True was happy.</p>

<p>“The Arab,” continued the father, “who lives with his
horse, and prizes him above his family, as is most meet
and proper, learns to know him well. There are those
in the Desert to-day who claim to trace the lineage of
their horses back to those of Mohammed. These they
train to endure hunger, fatigue and thirst to stand the
Desert life. Some are said to be able to travel eighty
leagues in twenty-four hours.”</p>

<p>There were modern incidents in Beautiful Bay’s lore—&#8203;tales
of the Southern States—&#8203;so lately colonies—&#8203;told
him by his famous father, Traveller, who was imported
from England and owned by Colonel Tayloe of Virginia.</p>

<p>“The blood of a thoroughbred flows quicker on the
course than on a hill-side farm,” said the old horse, and
related a story of the meet at Annapolis, when he and
Colonel De Lancey went down from New York to visit
The Dulaney of Maryland.</p>

<p>Discussing the merits of the horses stood a group of
the famous horsemen of the day: Tom Lee, of Virginia;
Mason, of Gunstan Hall, and De Lancey, of New York—&#8203;when
The Dulaney joined them.</p>

<p>“’Sdeath, De Lancey!” he cried, in his hearty voice,
“and right glad am I to see you here. These spindling
bets of fifty or a hundred pounds please me not. I want
gold, man, gold, I say!” Laughing carelessly, he flicked
a speck of dust from his coat sleeve with a white linen
handkerchief.</p>

<p>“Gold? Egad, so do I!” answered the rollicking De

Lancey. “What say you to a <em>peck</em> of gold? Neither
do I deal in quarters and halves.”</p>

<p>“Make it a struck <em>bushel</em> of Spanish dollars, and I will
back my horse against yours or the field!” cried the
Southerner.</p>

<p>The bet made was perhaps the most sensational money-bet
ever made on the Annapolis course.</p>

<p>Deafening cheers rent the air as The Dulaney’s horse
finished the one-mile circle a nose ahead.</p>

<h3>IN WHICH MISTRESS LLOYD, OF MARYLAND, GIVES TRUE
HIS FIRST RIBBAND.</h3>


<p>One sunny September morning, when the weather was
clear and fine and the trees were waving their crisp,
gay-tinted leaves over the grass-bordered roadways leading
to the fair-grounds, the horses were blanketed and
led towards the place of exhibition, for this was the great
opening of the Hartford Fair, and many had come from
as far as New York and Boston to attend it. There
was much prancing and side-stepping among the horses
after a fine breakfast to put them in a good humor.</p>

<p>True had been exhibited once at a small fair in Springfield
and knew a little of what was expected of him,
but of course this was a much greater occasion and a
sensation of slight nervousness and anticipation held his
heart.</p>

<p>Some of the younger horses were ill-mannered; they
bit at their grooms or snorted and showed their teeth
rudely, which astonished True, for he had been taught
to be polite always. Some of them grew very excited
and some knew they might change owners, and receive
prizes for this trait or that. It was a day long to be
remembered by them all.</p>

<p>What a scene met their eyes when, at last, they were
in sight of the Grounds! Early, as it was, there were
more men assembled together than True had ever seen
and they made a point of all talking at once, which confused
the horses no little; they shouted at the tops
of their voices, too, as if everybody were stone deaf.
</p>

<p>The women, however, stood quietly, and modestly at
one side in little sheltered booths where they displayed
in a most becoming manner their handiwork: quilts,
with beautiful and appropriate names, and wonderful
pieces of hand-woven homespun and linen. Farther on
True espied piles of carrots, squashes and other delicious
things which would have made his mouth water had
he not been so bewildered by the noises. Music sounded
and set him dancing and showing his remarkable muscles
to advantage.</p>

<p>Even Beautiful Bay, experienced as he must have
been in such events, seemed to be under the influence of
the lively atmosphere and curved his neck with spirit to
the admiration and respect of everyone who knew the
old horse. True felt a little anxiety for the result when
Beautiful Bay was led before the Judges, but this was
quite unnecessary; he returned with a blue ribband on
his bridle and a very satisfied look in his eye.</p>

<p>Then the Three-year-olds were called.</p>

<p>True’s temples throbbed; there were many beautiful
horses there and, being modest, he had not guessed that
he was the most beautiful and meritorious of them all.</p>

<p>When they were led out some bared their teeth, kicked
at each other, and misbehaved shockingly. The contrast
between True’s breeding and theirs was very
marked. When the Judges approached some of them
even went so far as to whirl for a kick!</p>

<p>True in his turn, however, stepped out briskly and
easily, small, lean head high, heavy black mane and tail
waving lightly in the morning breeze. But, all suddenly,
the stupid groom jerked his halter sharply.</p>

<p>Startled, the young horse flung himself backward.</p>

<p>“Now, you young rascal!” cried the lout, grandly, as
if he were Mahommed himself, “None of your capers
with <em>me</em>!”
</p>

<p>Not being accustomed to rudeness, True backed, indignantly,
and dragged the boy along with him.</p>

<p>At this moment there was a rustle, like leaves in autumn,
or the brush of wings, and the flying figure of a
maid seemed poised beside the little horse, so light and
airy was she.</p>

<p>All the odors of aromatic herbs and grasses of Arabia—&#8203;myrrh,
frankincense and balsam, of which his
mother had told him—&#8203;enveloped his imagination and delighted
his senses. He thrust his large tremulous nostrils
forward, hungry to inhale more deeply of this new
creature. Never had he scented her like before.</p>

<p>“Oh, please, Mr. Judge!” she cried, and as soon as
she spoke True recognized the dulcet tones of Mistress
Lloyd, of Maryland. Thrilling, as she caught his rein,
he calmed himself instantly. “Don’t let them jerk him
so! Ah, my Beauty,” she continued, putting her cheek
against his, “here is a piece of sugar for you!” She extended
the rose-leaf palm, from which he had seen his
father eat one day and on which was another bit of
maple sugar. “See, he is so <em>willing</em> to be good, <em>if you
will but let him</em>!”</p>

<p>When he had lipped her hand all over very gently,
to get the last crumb, True poked his small muzzle
into the hollow of her neck and listened to her voice
murmuring in his ear. All the soft breezes and blue
sky of the universe were concentrated in the delicious
spell of her presence, for this young maiden was one of
those rare human beings who possess a mysterious understanding
of animals, especially horses, which gives
a power and control over them—&#8203;almost miraculous.</p>

<p>True stepped carefully, lest his small well-shaped hoofs
might tread upon the marvellously tiny feet half hidden
beneath the flowered petticoat. All the while her voice was
saying soft, delightful things in his listening ear.
</p>

<p>When she finally gave up his rein and turned away,
the young horse followed, drawn as by a magnet and
dragged the groom with him, scarce seeming to feel the
boy pulling at the halter.</p>

<p>A murmur of polite laughter made Mistress Lloyd
look back.</p>

<p>Smiling sweetly, she turned and stroked True’s broad
forehead with her magic hand, and, telling him softly,
to “go back and be judged,” she reminded him he was
at a Fair.</p>

<p>Indeed he needed reminding, for so absorbed had he
been in her loveliness that he had forgotten all else!</p>

<p>The groom then gave a gentler tug at the halter and
True consented to be led before the Judges, who had not
yet told the people he was the finest Three-year-old in
New England. “The Hartford Wits” and their friends,
the Maryland Lloyds, watched the consultation of Judges,
hoping the ribband would be given to “Figure.”</p>

<p>In a few moments one of the committee came and
spoke a few words to Mistress Lloyd; she smiled with
pleasure, and nodded her pretty head in assent.</p>

<p>In another moment True heard the sound as of leaves
in an autumn forest, and there she was, beside him once
more, a fillet of blue in her hand.</p>

<p>Daintily she reached the headstall of his halter and
firmly she tied it on—&#8203;all the while talking to him, oh,
so sweetly:</p>

<p>“And so ’tis yours! I knew ’twould be, you beauty!
You’re far lovelier than your father, even, and you must
always be a good colt and make everybody love you as
you’ve made me!”</p>

<p>Somehow, True did not mind being called a “colt” by
her, it seemed more like a caress than patronage; but
had the <em>Coxcomb</em>, standing by, done it he would have
been tempted to take a whirl at him.
</p>

<p>“Some day,” went on Mistress Lloyd, “my father will
buy you for me and I shall take you down to Maryland—&#8203;I
want Tom Dulaney to see you!” True could
hear by the tones of her voice as she mentioned his name
that this <em>Tom Dulaney</em> must be a personage of consequence.
“You are small, and some might say not lean
enough to hunt, but you are the dearest animal I ever
won the love of!” For ’twas ever the habit of this fair
maid to weave her spell over animals, and well aware
was she of their response!</p>

<p>Then, oh, miracle of delights! as she finished tying
the strand she kissed his straight face with lips that
looked and smelled like crimson clover blossoms wet
with dew.</p>

<p>This perfumed dream was broken by a disagreeable
laugh, and a well-bred but none the less offensive voice
said:</p>

<p>“The brute will bite you, Mistress.”</p>

<p>It was the Coxcomb speaking.</p>

<p>“I am afraid of no horse living, Master Knickerbocker,”
she gave reply, quietly; then looking straight
at him, she finished, “horses are often truer than men.”</p>

<p>She turned quickly and joined her father.

<h3>TRUE GOES TO FOUND HIS RACE.</h3>


<p>Beautiful Bay boasted of having carried the Marquis
de Lafayette to the great banquet the Hartford people
gave him at the Bunch of Grapes Tavern, in 1784.
The reference to this made the younger horse hope, as
ever, rather recklessly, that another war might be declared
which would give him such opportunities to distinguish
himself as his father had had.</p>

<p>Sometimes father and son stood beneath the Elm on
Main street and Beautiful Bay told True of the meeting
there of Generals Washington, Hamilton and Knox,
in 1780, when they discussed the Yorktown campaign.
The ground under it was trodden hard, as if many
others had stood to tell or listen to the story.</p>

<p>One day True heard the tale of the Charter Oak as
they passed it on their way for a lounge on Sentinel
Hill; and he heard, too, the exciting times accompanying
the burning of the State House, in 1783.</p>

<p>Often they passed a queer looking young man; head
bent in thought, hands clasped behind his back, at whom
people pointed, saying with a shrug of understanding,
as if to make allowances for the eccentricities of a
scholar.</p>

<p>“There goes No-y Webster!”</p>

<p>Now and again the two horses went over to Mathew
Allyn’s mill where the stones turned corn into delicious
meal; or they made trips under the saddle up Rocky
Hill, where men were hanged from a gibbet over the

precipice if they had been wicked—&#8203;or if men <em>said</em> they
had—&#8203;which came to the same thing in the end.</p>

<p>Certain days each week were called “Market Days,”
and farmers came to Hartford to sell their produce.
The Meeting House bell called them together and when
True was present they often stood near to admire him
and invite him to visit their farms. These were very
profitable experiences to True and his owner, for there
was always plenty of good food and bedding.</p>

<p>It was with no little regret, therefore, that True found
one day Master Morgan was making ready to leave, and
he must say good-bye to his father and friends in that
pleasant town.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, when they set out, and turned their
faces northward, he stepped out with a stout heart, remembering
his mother’s instruction:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
    <div class="verse indent0a">“Duty that we cheerfully do,</div>
    <div class="verse indent0">Is always quickest through!”</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>The highway they took was the one they had travelled
when on their way to Hartford, and True’s spirits rose,
thinking he might soon see his dear mother and Caesar.
He would have so much to tell them of his experiences
in the great world.</p>

<p>A feeling of keen content and happiness swept over
him as he cantered easily along the banks of the stately
Connecticut River, or stopped to graze on the rich abundant
grass bordering the roadway.</p>

<p>’Twas at turn of day he felt a sweet nearness to his
old home, and by a thousand familiar signs and senses
he knew they were approaching. Plucking up all his courage
and enthusiasm, he increased his speed and, almost
breathless with joy, stopped at the familiar barn-door
and whinneyed twice in the old way.</p>

<p>There was no response.
</p>

<p>His heart sank; a sudden anxiety seized him.</p>

<p>Finally Caesar appeared and purred a soft welcome
as he rubbed against his old friend’s leg. True made
hurried enquiries as to his mother’s welfare, while Master
Morgan gave “halloo!” for the inmates of the house.</p>

<p>“Alas,” mewed the cat, sitting down to wash his face,
“things have changed since you went away. Your
mother is sold into the <span class="lock">South——”</span></p>

<p>“Into the South!” interrupted True, but Caesar saw
nothing exciting in that, and continued, placidly:</p>

<p>—“and our master lies ill of the fever, our mistress
ever at his side and no one to notice <em>me</em> at all.
The stables are lonely, even the rats and mice have
moved away for lack of food, for the garden and farm
are grown up in weeds.” And he wiped his paw surreptitiously
across his eye, curled himself up on a beam
and fell asleep.</p>

<p>The responsive tears filled True’s eyes, and he would
have roused the cat with other questions but at the moment
Mistress Whitman opened the kitchen door. She
offered Master Morgan friendly greeting, but when she
caught sight of True she ran quickly out and threw her
arms about his neck. Her old pet was equally glad to
see her and thrust his muzzle into the folds of the white
kerchief about her neck and made little affectionate
sounds of greeting in reply.</p>

<p>“Come, True, little pony,” she whispered, “he has almost
grieved himself to death at parting from you. The
very sight of you will make him better.”</p>

<p>Without ado, she led the horse right up the two stone
steps and into the kitchen where once he and his mother
had stolen soup out of the pot which was even now
swinging from the crane. As he recalled the incident
he thrust his wide nostrils forward, but, smiling sadly,
Mistress Whitman drew him to the inner door. His

shod hoofs made an unseemly stamping, and a feeble
voice from beyond called:</p>

<p>“Nay, wife, there must be something wrong!”</p>

<p>Mistress Whitman opened the door wide and let light
into the darkened room.</p>

<p>“Instead, dear husband, ’tis very right,” she cried,
cheerily, “for here is our precious colt come to visit
with you.”</p>

<p>True found himself in a small, bare room, standing
beside a cot, and, as his eyes grew accustomed to the
dimness, he recognized his old master, wasted with illness,
lying helpless before him, his cheeks flushed, his
eyes bright with fever. The affectionate little horse
nosed among the quilts, trying to express his joy at
seeing his old friend and at the same time his grief at
finding him so weak and ill.</p>

<p>“Wife,” called the sick man, presently, “wife, fetch
me some maple sugar and do go into the barn and give
the colt all there is left of food there.”</p>

<p>“I will pay you well, Mistress,” said Master Morgan,
from the doorway.</p>

<p>“Pay us, sir?” said the feeble voice from the cot, “pay
us, sir? For feeding True? Why, bless you, he is one
of my own family. I should as soon think of taking pay
for food I might give my good wife, there. ’Twas only
misfortune that led me to part with our pet. But you
mean well, sir, and I bear you no ill-will.”</p>

<p>It was thus that True was loved by those who understood
his nature.</p>

<p>When at last he was led to the stable he whinneyed
twice for Caesar, with leaping heart.</p>

<p>“Was the one from the South who purchased my
mother,” he asked, “a peerless lily of a maid, with crow-black
hair and stars for eyes? Had she palms like the

petals of a wild-rose and did she smell like clover blossoms
after a sudden shower?”</p>

<p>But Caesar had not noticed, he said, as he sat on the
edge of the doorsill, and began his inevitable face-washing.</p>

<p>“Had not noticed! Then indeed, it was not she,”
thought True, impatient with the cat. Even a <em>cat</em> would
have noticed Mistress Lloyd.</p>

<p>He spent a lonely night and was relieved to set out
early in the morning for Randolph, Vermont, where Justin
Morgan lived; the old home was not what it had
been and any change was better than the atmosphere
that hung over all at the Whitman farm.</p>

<p>Besides, Justin Morgan was kind to him and they
were good friends enough, and no doubt Randolph was
as good a village as Springfield. He grew philosophic
as they started off.</p>

<p>They galloped over fields and through vague roads,
or walked under vast overhanging and dense forests,
and in time they came in sight of the bold, heavily-timbered
Green Mountains—&#8203;“The Footstools of Allah,” his
mother had called them. They gave the young horse
a feeling of strength and confidence; he felt his muscles
expand at sight of their bold outlines and he had no
fear of their difficulties. From the top of one he gazed
at the view, entranced, rearing his fine bony head and
breathing deeply of the pure life-giving air.</p>

<p>According to his mother’s prophecy it would be in the
shadow of these mountains that he, scion of a hundred
famous horses, would found the new race, and at first
sight of their high broken sky-line, he made a resolve to
live such an exemplary life that it would be a standard
for that race to come.</p>

<p>Master Morgan was town-clerk, school-teacher, and
singing master, and went daily from place to place with

books in his saddle bags; it was this life True had come
to share. There was a comfortable stable but no stable-mates,
and had they not been constantly on the go, True
might have been lonely; he came to look for their trips
with much content and cantered along right willingly
from one place to another.</p>

<p>For a time he was hitched outside the schoolhouse
door, but when Master Morgan found he would come
at his whistle, he let the little horse graze at will—&#8203;the
bridle fastened securely to the saddle—&#8203;and to make the
acquaintance of other horses during school hours. He
knew well True would not abuse this privilege and wander
too far.</p>

<p>Thus the first weeks of his stay at Randolph were
passed.</p>

<p>As winter set in his sensitive ears detected, high in
the air, a snapping of the cold which disturbed him no
little, owing to his fear of storms. One night, when this
sound was more audible than it had ever been, he pawed
and stamped so restlessly that Justin Morgan came to
find out what the matter was.</p>

<p>As the stable door opened there flashed through it a
flood of crimson light. In the North great shafts pierced
from the horizon high into the centre of the heavens.
Poor True gave a moan of fright and crowded into a
corner of his stall—&#8203;it looked so like that awful fire in
which old Piebald Ceph had lost his life.</p>

<p>Master Morgan closed the door hurriedly.</p>

<p>“Why, you poor horse,” he said, kindly, “’tis nothing
but the Northern lights. Steady, now, steady.”</p>

<p>’Twas not so much the words as the tone and the
gentle pats on his shoulder that pacified True. He felt
at once that his master would take care of him and
calmed himself like a sensible animal.</p>

<p>When he was quieted Justin Morgan climbed into the

hay-loft and down a ladder on the other side of the
barn rather than let the light shine through the door
again, which was very considerate and no doubt True
was proportionately grateful.</p>

<p>Those were wild, unsettled days in Vermont, and tales
of Indians pillaging and burning were so fresh in the
minds of the pioneers that a certain feeling of insecurity
remained, ready to be roused into action any minute.
The forests were dense and dark, the farms scattered
and lonely and the life primitive. Neighbors depended
solely upon each other for assistance in times of trouble
or danger.</p>

<p>Dame Margery Griswold—&#8203;daughter of a friendly Indian
chief, and wife of a white settler—&#8203;was one of the
fine and noble characters of Randolph. Wise in the
ways of medicines and herb-teas, she was constantly
called upon to administer to the sick, and never failed to
respond, rain or shine, snow or sleet.</p>

<p>One cold, blustery night there came a need for her to
go across the mountain to see a child lying sick of a
fever.</p>

<p>When she called upon her old white mare she was met
by a flat refusal; the poor old nag was crippled with
rheumatism and could not rise from her stable floor
where she lay on her bedding of dried leaves.</p>

<p>Dame Margery therefore consulted Uncle Peter Edson,
to whom all turned for advice, he being the oldest
man in the town and a Deacon in the church.</p>

<p>Not long after this Master Morgan was awakened by
a smart rapping on his door.</p>

<p>“Who’s there?” he called, sleepily.</p>

<p>“Wake, Friend Justin,” cried Uncle Peter, for ’twas
he. “Dame Margery would borrow your horse Figure
for the night. She is sent for to doctor a sick child.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a raw night for the dame, no less my horse,”

answered Morgan, lifting the latch and inviting the old
man in out of the cold. The ever-smouldering back-log
kept the fire ready to blow into a blaze any time and
Justin Morgan, not disturbing his family, set about fanning
it with a large, turkey-tail fan. “I do not wish to
send my horse out on such a night. We’ve but just got
in ourselves and are fagged,” he added.</p>

<p>The fire blazed and was soon roaring up the chimney
as the lightwood caught and the pine-knots flamed; then
Master Morgan straightened himself.</p>

<p>“By the Constitution of these United States,” cried the
old man, “’tis not a time to think of brute-beasts. I
tell you a <em>human</em> lies ill and needs the Dame. Come,
come, have done, and let me fetch the horse from the
stable!”</p>

<p>But Master Morgan still hesitated, as he hung the
turkey-tail back in place beside the high mantel.</p>

<p>“Come, I say,” thundered the old man, whom everyone
obeyed, “get the horse out, sir, or ’twill be the worse
for you when the neighbors find you consider your animal
before a human being.”</p>

<p>Such threats and language could not be withstood, and
Master Morgan, ever willing to be of service to a fellow
being, and only reluctant on account of the tired
horse, took his lanthorn from the mantel-shelf and went
out.</p>

<p>As soon as True left the protection of his stable he
felt a storm brewing, not so far away either; he hoped it
would not break before his return, yet not knowing
where he was going.</p>

<p>Uncle Peter rode him over to Dame Margery’s, who,
when she came out, was so bundled up in bearskins that
had she not spoken at once True might have been startled.
Throwing her bags across the saddle and bidding

Uncle Peter a cheery good-night she set out on her errand.</p>

<p>It was a cruel night, clouds large and low swept over
the moon’s face and piled themselves up along the horizon
like banks of snow. Dame Margery spoke soothingly
and blithely to the horse which partly reconciled him to
the dire cold.</p>

<p>When they arrived at their destination Margery went
into the hut and a young man came out to throw a fur
square over True’s shivering back and lead him out of
the wind.</p>

<p>Hours passed. Inside the hut a child lay on a pallet on
the floor; Margery knelt beside it. Finally she withdrew
her arm from beneath the little head very gently and
rose to her full, lean height. The white-faced, dry-eyed
mother stood near—&#8203;undemonstrative as Vermont women
are apt to be but none the less grateful for all their stillness.</p>

<p>She followed Margery to the door as the latter stepped
out into the bitter night.</p>

<p>“Looks like a storm,” Margery said, over her shoulder.
“See that you don’t forget the pleurisy-root tea—&#8203;and
have it piping hot!”</p>

<p>“Best tarry the night,” urged the woman, hospitably,
from the door where she stood, screening a sputtering
dip from the wind with her hand.</p>

<p>“Nay, nay, yet I give you thanks,” answered Margery,
gaily. “I am not afraid of storms; I was born in
one and brought up in a wigwam!”</p>

<p>She pulled the covering from True’s back and
mounted.</p>

<p>They started just as a veil of blinding snow fell full
in their faces—&#8203;and it fell so fast the ground was soon
white.</p>

<p>The vicious wind, like an unchained demon, caught

True’s thick black mane and blew it upwards, giving him
a spasm of cold on his neck. He shivered. A moan
swept through the hemlock boughs, they bent before the
wind. Margery moistened the end of her finger and held
it up, a thin skin of ice formed on its front.</p>

<p>Beaten by the wind and blinded by the snow his old
storm-terror came over the horse, he wheeled and let the
biting blast beat against his haunches—&#8203;head down and
heavy black tail against the on coming snow and numbing
cold.</p>

<p>Once or twice he sniffed, as if in consultation with his
rider, but as she offered no advice, he sprang to the
shelter of a clump of firs and the harsh wind whistled
fiercely on.</p>

<p>Margery slid from the saddle and with stiff but deft
hands she caught True’s foot and threw him, Indian-fashion,
to the ground. Then she broke huge branches
of hemlock and piled them up as a brake against the
snow, crouching close to the willing body of the now
motionless horse. The wind, making a grating sound,
pressed hard against their brake but it did not give, and
trembling with cold the two waited for the storm to pass.
The snow fell and fell; like knives the icy splinters
lashed their eyelids and swirled on, tossing wave upon
wave of snow on their protection of boughs and mounding
it almost over them.</p>

<p>A large branch, heavy with the weight of ice and
sleet, snapped from a tree near by and crashed to the
ground, but they did not stir.</p>

<p>Angry mutterings came to them through the evergreen
branches and shrieked off over the mountains like wind-tossed
spirits. Through the long hours they made hardly
a movement.</p>

<p>At last the darkness was over and from out the place
where it went the sun came, flashing long rays of gold

on trees draped with icicles and a world carpeted with
snow, sparkling and gleaming, dazzling their eyes with
its glitter.</p>

<p>A strange calm had fallen on the wind-swept scene
when they rose and shook themselves, stiff with cold, to
set off homeward. Over all the glistening landscape
hung a deep-blue sky, calm, serene.</p>

<p>It was his hardihood that saved the little horse, but
good Dame Margery Griswold caught her death that
night while the child she braved the storm to save lived
on to bless her name.

<h3>TRUE’S FIRST HARD WORK, AND HOW HE ACCOMPLISHED IT.</h3>


<p>Upon a hill at Randolph Centre perched a little store
where the farmers gathered in cold weather to warm
themselves with Medford rum, a common enough drink
in those days, to express lavish opinions as to political
affairs of the young nation, so lately separated from her
Mother Country, or to discuss more intimate local business.</p>

<p>Master Morgan drank little, being more inclined to
quiet study than sociability, but his way led past the
store and he often stopped to hear the news. There
were no newspapers in those days, and all news came by
letter or word-of-mouth of the stage-drivers.</p>

<p>Whilst waiting outside for his owner True made
pleasant acquaintances among the horses who also stood
awaiting their riders.</p>

<p>A grey mare, very old, very wise and very strong in
her convictions, whom he often met, told him many
mane-raising stories of Indian days—&#8203;so recently passed
through—&#8203;and the more his wide-set ears pointed and
the more his dark prominent eyes grew eager the better
the old pioneer liked it.</p>

<p>One of her strange tales was how she discovered her
master, Experience Davis, after he returned from his
two years’ captivity with the Indians.</p>

<p>One day, she told True, as she stood quietly near
Davis’ hut, nibbling lazily among the stumps and stones

of the new-cleared field to get the last blades of grass and
weeds, she heard a frightful sound approaching.</p>

<p>She thrilled with horror!</p>

<p>Davis, hoeing, hard by, also heard and dashed frantically
into his hut, closing the door and barring it securely—&#8203;right
well did everyone of the time know what
those dreadful war-whoops and blood-curdling yells foreboded!</p>

<p>Old Grey threw back her head and sniffed for a better
scent with red, comprehending nostrils. Then, as a
band of painted, half-naked savages, brandishing their
tomahawks, rushed from the forest, she snorted and fled—&#8203;her
sparse tail high in the air, her heart stricken with
fear.</p>

<p>On an eminence afar, she stopped and saw the
wretches burst open the hut-door and drag her struggling
master out. Binding him tightly, and securing everything
that might be of use, they set fire to the hut and
disappeared into the forest with war-whoops, taking
Davis with them.</p>

<p>Old Grey waited sadly on the river-bank until hunger
and loneliness induced her to return. Alas, the ruin that
met her eyes!</p>

<p>A neighbor who had escaped the massacre of that day
found her, wandering about in despair, and, thinking
his friend Experience must have been burned in his
hut or scalped, took the old mare to share such life as
the pioneers of that day had to endure. When he went
to live in Hanover, Old Grey went along, too.</p>

<p>One fine sunny day two years later, as she stood
hitched in the old Meeting House yard, she felt a thrill,
her heart began suddenly to beat faster, she looked
around, disturbed in spirit for some strange, unknown
reason.</p>

<p>At last she saw a man crossing the yard, and a moment

later recognized her old friend Experience Davis!</p>

<p>Fearing he would pass without seeing her, she whinneyed,
once-and-a-half, as had been her wont.</p>

<p>Davis stopped, glanced about, mystified, and was going
on when she repeated her greeting, anxiously. At that
he looked at her, sharply and curiously. Involuntarily
he answered, with his old familiar whistle.</p>

<p>At sound of this Old Grey was so overcome with joy
that she snapped her hitch-rein with a quick jerk, and
trotted right up to him!</p>

<p>He was so pale and thin from long captivity that she
would hardly have known him by sight, alone; it was
his scent that convinced her infallible nostrils that he was
really her once ruddy and strong master.</p>

<p>Davis took her back to the old place where he had
just rebuilt the hut and stable and there they had lived
happily together ever since.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>On the Highway from Boston to Canada, stood Benedict’s
Tavern, and here True often met distinguished
horses on their way to or from the race course on The
Plains of Abraham, in Quebec, where men sent their
horses from great distances to test their speed against
other horses. There were then, in the United States of
America, no race-courses.</p>

<p>It was at this stage-house, no doubt, that in True was
first born that racing spirit, of which nothing came for
a long time.</p>

<p>In the late winter of his first year at Randolph, Master
Morgan fell ill with lung-trouble; he had to give
up his teaching and singing and, finding he could not
afford to keep a horse, hired True out to one Robert
Evans, a farmer and hunter, solid as granite, and kindly,
to clear fifteen acres of heavy-timbered land.
</p>

<p>For this task Evans agreed to pay Morgan fifteen dollars
and to feed the horse.</p>

<p>Evans, big chinned and grey eyed, was a lean and
sinewy frontiersman, poor and hard-working, with a
large family, and True knew, intuitively, that his days
of pleasant jaunting about the country under the saddle
were over. However, with that indomitable courage,
which characterizes his descendants to this day, he set
about the difficult task and by the first of June it was
finished, without help from any other horse.<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<p>He never regretted this work for it developed his
chest and leg muscles early in life, muscles, the like of
which had not been known before in a horse of his
size.</p>

<p>The setting of many of True’s most interesting experiences
and exciting adventures at this period of his life,
was Chase’s Mill. This busy spot was situated on the
wooded bank of the White River, as pretty a bit of
Vermont as one could find in a day’s journey. The
river sparkled and laughed between green banks and
leaped merrily over the mill-wheel; spruce and firs thrust
thirsty feet deep down in the water and reared tall heads
high into the upper air to catch the sun’s rays; perfume
of wild flowers loaded the breeze; birds sang all day,
and white stemmed birches guarded the nearby forest
like soldiers standing in a row, straight and firm.</p>

<p>Miller Chase plied an honest trade in Medford rum
while the farmers waited for the wobbly stones to grind
their corn or the saws to saw their logs. Horses and
oxen grazed at hand, taking the opportunity to enjoy
the delicious grass growing so abundantly in the rich,
fertile valley.</p>

<p>One day True chanced to remark upon this grass to
his friend Old Grey.
</p>

<p>“Know you not,” she asked, astonished at his youthful
ignorance, “how it came to be broadcast here?”</p>

<p>“Not I!” whinneyed True. Suffice it that he was enjoying
its satisfying plentifulness to the fullest after his
hard day in the plow.</p>

<p>And she told him.</p>

<p>After the massacre, in which her master, Experience
Davis, had been captured, in plundering Zadock Steele’s
hut, before burning it, an Indian found a sack of valuable
grass-seed. He put it over his shoulder and started
off down the valley.</p>

<p>After a while he noticed, vaguely, that his load, unlike
the usual manner of loads, became lighter the
farther he travelled, but he stupidly did not think to
glance over his shoulder at his burden.</p>

<p>When he reached Dog River there was not a grass-seed
left in the sack!</p>

<p>Through a tiny hole in the bag he had, unintentionally,
sown this wonderful seed all the way from Randolph,
and for years it grew up, unmowed, uneaten, and
almost man-high, to make the White River Valley famous,
and supply grass and hay for farmers and horses.</p>

<h3>IN WHICH “TRUE” BECOMES “JUSTIN MORGAN.”</h3>


<p>Once or twice a week it was the custom among the
farmers, waiting at Chase’s Mill, to pass the time testing
their strength or that of their horses. It was healthful
sport and kept them and their beasts in trim.</p>

<p>Many were the jugs of Medford rum consumed on
these occasions, and anyone having a horse to try, or a
new test of strength for the men, was welcomed.</p>

<p>Running their horses short distances for small stakes
came to be very popular.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> A course of eighty rods was
measured, starting at the mill and extending along the
highway; a line was drawn across the road, called a
“scratch,” the horses were ranged in a row, and at the
drop of a hat away they went, cheered by the crowd.</p>

<p>It so happened that Evans and True, who never finished
their work until dusk, were rarely at these tests.
Evans, himself, was too tired to join in the sports, but
True often thought he would like to try his strength
against the larger, heavier horses.</p>

<p>One day, coming along the River Road to the mill,
his heavy farm-harness and tug-chains still dangling on
True, they passed Master Justin Morgan—&#8203;he stood under
a maple tree and was lilting an old French song learned
from the Canadian lumbermen, called “A la Claire Fontaine.”
True and Evans paused to listen. Everyone
liked Master Morgan for his sweet voice and gentle
manners.
</p>

<p>When the song was finished Evans gave the singer
neighborly greeting and strode on to the mill, True following
him, more like a dog than a horse.</p>

<p>The sun was gone and the evening shadows were beginning
to fall, but there were still lingering along the
horizon long streaks of crimson and gold that tinged
the river with color.</p>

<p>In evident discussion, near a log at the mill, stood a
group of farmers.</p>

<p>Evans and True approached.</p>

<p>Nathan Nye, friendly and jovial, whittling a birch
stick, looked up as Evans said: “How be ye all?”</p>

<p>“Why not give Bob’s horse a show?” he asked, a
twinkle in his keen blue eyes, a smile brightening his
genial face.</p>

<p>Horses and oxen were hitched to the limbs of trees
or grazed near at hand, quite without interest in whatever
was taking place. Sledges and wagons rested their
shafts on the ground, seeming to wait patiently.</p>

<p>“Is it a pulling bee?” asked Evans, leaning against
True’s side.</p>

<p>“Yaas, but I guess it’s abeout over, now,” drawled a
lank youth, coming out of the mill with a sack of meal
on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Anybody but you in a hurry to be going home-along?”
questioned Nye, crushingly.</p>

<p>The youth did not answer, but went on to his sledge.</p>

<p>“There’s a jug of Medford rum in the store for the
owner of the horse that can get that there log on my runway
this evening,” explained Miller Chase to Evans.</p>

<p>“Now I want to know!” exclaimed Evans, carelessly,
“Why didn’t you say so before? You seem to be making
quite a chore of a very simple thing; I’ll just have
my little horse do it for you in a jiffy!”</p>

<p>A shout of derisive laughter greeted his remark.
</p>

<p>“Now do tell!” cried Hiram Sage, sarcastically.</p>

<p>“That pony pull a log my Jim refused?” scoffed another.</p>

<p>“My ‘pony,’ as you call him,” laughed Evans, good-naturedly,
“has never refused me yet.” He placed his
arm over True’s neck; the horse rattled his chains musically,
and reached for a low-handing bough.</p>

<p>“Work is play for this animal,” Evans went on.
“We’ve been in the logging-field all day, but that don’t
make a mite o’ difference to the Morgan horse. Come,
show us your log!”</p>

<p>True shook himself again and went on chewing leaves.</p>

<p>“Why, that beast’s naught but a colt!” said Jim’s
owner, scornfully.</p>

<p>“Colt or no, he’s the finest bit o’ horse-flesh this side
of The Plains of Abraham!” Evans contended, hotly.
“Give him his head and he goes like a shot and doesn’t
pull an ounce, and as for drawing a load—&#8203;when this
horse starts, <em>something’s</em> got to come! That is,” he
added with a laugh, “as long as the tugs last!”</p>

<p>“Well, stop your bragging,” said the sarcastic Hiram;
“actions speak louder than words. Hitch him up that
there ‘something’ and let us see it ‘come’.”</p>

<p>Miller Chase stepped forward, hospitably.</p>

<p>“First come in, men, and fix up your bets over a mug,”
he said.</p>

<p>They went inside the shop, all talking at once, and
left True nibbling among the grasses and weeds. When
they had disappeared he glanced at the log which the
other horses had “refused”—&#8203;horses much larger and
heavier than he. The opportunity he had hoped for
had come!</p>

<p>“But can I do it?” he asked himself.</p>

<p>The answer was, he <em>could</em>, and <em>would</em>.</p>

<p>He was spurred to the greatest effort of his life by

the taunt that he was a “pony.” At any rate he was over
fourteen hands and weighed nine hundred and fifty
pounds!</p>

<p>“As I understand it,” Evans was saying, as the men
came out of the shop, “the agreement is that my horse
has got to pull that big log ten rods onto the logway,
<em>in three pulls</em>, or I lose?”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea, exactly,” assented Miller Chase.</p>

<p>Evans took hold of True’s bridle confidently, and led
him to the enormous log, where he fastened the tugs
properly. Then he stepped one side and looked the
young horse straight in the eye.</p>

<p>True returned his look—&#8203;they might almost have been
said to have exchanged a wink.</p>

<p>At this thought, Evans shouted with laughter.</p>

<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, when he could speak seriously,
“I am ashamed to ask my horse to pull a little weight
like that <em>on a test</em>—&#8203;couldn’t two or three of you get on
and ride?”</p>

<p>Then Evans was <em>sure</em> he saw a twinkle in True’s eye.</p>

<p>A loud laugh greeted the proposal.</p>

<p>“But, man, that there’s a dead lift!” expostulated the
miller.</p>

<p>“Well, mine’s a live horse,” Evans cried, with a grin.
“Get on there! Justin Morgan’s waitin’ for to take
you to drive!”</p>

<p>From this day the young horse was called <cite>Justin Morgan’s</cite>.
It was an easy transition to drop the possessive
“s,” after a while, and call him “Justin Morgan.”</p>

<p>With much hilarity three men climbed up on the log.</p>

<p>By this time darkness had fallen and Master Chase
ran to get his lanthorn, swinging it back and forth, as he
returned.</p>

<p>“Mind you don’t fall off,” Evans warned the men.
“‘Something’ is about to ‘come’.”
</p>

<p>And “something” did!</p>

<p>Justin Morgan’s horse gathered himself together, almost
crouching, and waited for the word to start. When
it was given, his chest-muscles strained, his wide nostrils
were scarlet and dilated, and this scion of Arabia’s proud
breed moved off as if inspired by Allah himself for an
almost miraculous feat.</p>

<p>The bystanders, craning their necks to see, ran alongside;
the men, perched on the log, fell off as it rocked
from side to side, and then the young horse paused for
breath—&#8203;or to recover his strength.</p>

<p>Utter silence was over all. There was no jeering now.</p>

<p>The second pull landed the log on the logway, and the
amazed men broke into the wildest cheers ever heard at
Chase’s Mill.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<h3>MORGAN TRIES CONCLUSIONS WITH THE COXCOMB AND
HIS FRIENDS.</h3>


<p>After his triumph at Chase’s Mill, the Morgan and
Evans often stopped there on their way home from work.</p>

<p>A welcome more cordial than usual greeted them one
sweet and tranquil afternoon. Cowbells tinkled in the
distance, coming home along the River Road for the
milking hour, and the chains of Morgan’s harness jangled
an echo from his sides. The leather parts of this harness
were mended here and there with bits of white string,
and his usually glossy, short hair was rough and lacked
care. He was not pretty, but always bold and fearless
in his style of movement.</p>

<p>As was his custom, Nathan Nye sat whittling his birch
stick into useless shavings.</p>

<p>“Let the Morgan see if it’s <em>in him to do it</em>!” he cried
to Evans.</p>

<p>“What’s the game to-day?” asked Evans, cheerfully.</p>

<p>With a backward nod and a frown Nye indicated three
strangers standing in the doorway of the little shop.</p>

<p>“Travellers from over to Benedict’s,” he explained,
in an undertone. “They heard about our horse and
have come to try out against him. I’ve got a sneaking
idea that we can take the starch out o’ their biled shirts
for ’em!” He shut his knife with a determined click
and rose. “<em>They</em> claim size is necessary for speed and
endurance,” he went on; “they are just from The Plains
of Abraham; on their way back to New York; came yesterday

and hearing at the stage-house that we had something
of a horse in these parts staid over to-day to
satisfy their curiosity.”</p>

<p>“We’ll satisfy it!” laughed Evans, confidently.</p>

<p>Three strange horses stood hitched near by, and Evans
went to take a look at them, as if casually. The Morgan
followed, as a faithful dog might, extending his
nostrils as he caught sight of a cloak thrown over one
of the saddles. He caught the scent and blew his breath
on it in a disgusted way. He had recognized the odor
of the Coxcomb, Master Knickerbocker!</p>

<p>Nye had also followed Evans.</p>

<p>“I’d just like to show these New York dandies the
sort of horses we can raise in Vermont,” he said, apparently
oblivious of the fact that the best and first part
of True’s raising had been done in Massachusetts. “Even
if we can’t afford to use all that ody cologne, and wear
frills on our shirt fronts. They say these two horses
were bred on the Winooski at the Ethan Allen farm, but
this one”—&#8203;he indicated the horses as he spoke—&#8203;“is from
down New York way.”</p>

<p>Evans walked around and looked at them critically.</p>

<p>“Good horses, all of them,” he remarked, with appreciation,
“and fresh.”</p>

<p>“Rested all night at the Inn,” Nye corroborated, resentfully.</p>

<p>The Morgan was working himself up over the scent
of the cloak—&#8203;any test for him against the horse on whose
saddle it lay was as good as won already. He had an
intuition that Mistress Lloyd would like him to defeat
the Coxcomb, whose horse was a fretful, vicious animal—&#8203;handsome
enough, it was true, and with many races
to his credit—&#8203;but he was too full of conceit and self-confidence
to please Morgan.</p>

<p>The Ethan Allen horses were quieter and gave the

impression of reserve power. All three were stylish
and well cared for, while Morgan was ungroomed and
neglected; there were a few burrs in his heavy black
tail, too, which seemed to strike the New Yorkers as
extremely amusing. The Morgan, himself, however,
had never seen anything very comical about a mere
cockle-burr, and was nettled at their foolish remarks and
jeers.</p>

<p>“Yes,” repeated Nye, “fresh as flowers, and fed to the
top-notch. Those men have a fine plan to take us down
a peg or two.”</p>

<p>“Is it a clean, fair race, think you?” asked Evans,
under his breath.</p>

<p>“It’s no clean and no fair race,” Nye gave reply, indignantly,
and in the same low, resentful tone he added,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a>
“they want our horse to run three separate races, one
after the other, and him all tuckered out with a day’s
plowing.”</p>

<p>“It ain’t fair,” agreed Evans, vehemently. “My horse
ain’t only tired, but my saddle and bridle, that I left
over here t’other day, ain’t light and easy like theirs.
It ain’t reasonable…. Not but what Morgan can
do it,” he added, quickly, “but it’s hard on him.”</p>

<p>“Of course he can do it,” assented Nye, confidently.
“They say we’ve got to show ’em—&#8203;or shut up our bragging
over to Benedict’s—&#8203;with the word being passed on
from North to South, as never was!”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Evans. “We’ll show ’em. As long
as Morgan’s alive we ain’t got no cause to shut up bragging.”</p>

<p>“Every man to ride his own horse,” Nye further explained.</p>

<p>“My legs are a leetle mite too long to be pretty,”
laughed Evans. “But if Morgan can stand it, I can.”
</p>

<p>True heard all this as he stood cropping grass near at
hand. When they ceased speaking he came and rubbed
his nose on Evans’ shoulder reassuringly, as he often did
in his affectionate, demonstrative way.</p>

<p>At this moment the strangers joined them, and True
recognized the Coxcomb as he swaggered forward, tapping
his tall boots with a beautiful riding whip. Spurs
gleamed on his heels and his insolent manner was in
strong contrast to the simple bearing of the straightforward
farmer’s.</p>

<p>At a glance, Morgan had seen it would be no great
feat to beat the Ethan Allen horses, but he also saw
with the same quick glance that the New York horse
was to be reckoned with; he was evidently accustomed
to successes on the course.</p>

<p>When the races were arranged, Evans removed the
dangling plow-harness from True’s back. At sight of
him without it the strangers seemed to be more amused
than ever. Their contemptuous remarks affronted Evans.</p>

<p>“Fix up your bets,” he called out a moment later, impatiently,
seeing how uncomfortable True was with his
cumbersome saddle and coarse bit. “I want to get home-along.”</p>

<p>He spoke as if he were so sure of winning that it was
but the question of a moment or so.</p>

<p>His tone irritated the Coxcomb. He came forward.</p>

<p>“Odd brute that,” he sneered, “to put against horses
that have won on The Plains of Abraham. But I suppose
the <em>fun</em> of the races will make up to you for your
losses. Why, this is nothing but a Canadian scrub!”</p>

<p>True shook himself in disgust. To be called a striding
Canadian. A horse who travels with purposed exertion,
while he glided over the ground with scarce an
effort. A Canadian scrub, indeed, a horse whose thick
nostrils speak of low birth and whose flat sides and thick

hair seem made for much cold and beating; and <em>he</em>, with
the blood of the South in his veins!</p>

<p>It was too much for Evans.</p>

<p>“This is no Canadian,” he contradicted, shortly; “this
horse is a Thoroughbred.”</p>

<p>The Coxcomb laughed derisively, and flicked his boot.</p>

<p>“None the less, the brute would answer to the order
‘<i lang="fr">Marches donc!</i>’… Not so, my friend?” He
struck True on the side with his keen whip, making him
spring forward.</p>

<p>“What said I?” he scoffed with a shrug. “The <em>horse</em>
does not lie about his pedigree.”</p>

<p>Ignoring the insulting inference, Evans quieted Morgan
with a caress and cried:</p>

<p>“For shame, sir! Would you have me strike <em>your</em>
horse thus?”</p>

<p>But Master Knickerbocker had moved away, laughing
insolently.</p>

<p>The course was measured, the scratch drawn and
Nathan Nye stood ready to drop the hat. Several of the
men went to the finish-line to witness and testify to the
result of the three races.</p>

<p>The course faced the east, so that the eyes of the
horses and their riders were turned from the sunset glow
which was then illumining the world. The road was
smooth, and a recent rain had laid the dust; the conditions
were better than usual. The pungent odor of new-sawn
lumber filled the air and the chirping of birds from
the nearby forest made sweet music.</p>

<p>One of the Ethan Allen horses walked briskly forward
under his rider, while the Morgan joined him in the
friendly way which was his natural manner towards all
animals. They waited pleasantly, yet spiritedly, for the
drop of the hat.</p>

<p>When the signal was given they ran neck and neck

for a short distance—&#8203;then with a sudden and unexpected
spurt the Morgan dashed in a length ahead.</p>

<p>His friends cheered Morgan lustily; the other faction
were too astonished to other than gasp slightly, and
were silent. Evans himself was expressionless—&#8203;if anything,
he, as well as Morgan, looked a little bored at the
easy victory, and cantered back to the starting point for
the next race with a sort of indifference.</p>

<p>The second was twin to the first. Morgan seemed
just waking up, as he sprang forward perfunctorily at
the finish, winning with ease. He moved as if he knew
not fatigue, even after the hard day’s work. It was the
Desert training of his ancestors within him, their marvellous
staying qualities.</p>

<p>When they returned the second time the Coxcomb was
waiting, his restive horse trembling in anticipation of a
victory.</p>

<p>One or two false starts, and they were off.</p>

<p>The Morgan was away toward the goal like an arrow
from an Indian’s bow—&#8203;his small extended muzzle and
deep wide chest seemed to cut the air. In the short
length of the course he thought of Flying Childers winning
his historic race against the runner Fox, about
seventy-five years before, of which his father told him.
Perhaps this memory and the strain of this great ancestor
awakened possibilities within him—&#8203;the road ran
past, his small, well shaped black feet spurned the earth,
and before he knew it he was at the finish almost a length
ahead of the horse who had won so many races on The
Plains of Abraham.</p>

<p>The chagrin of his antagonist’s rider was not lessened
by the laughs and cheers of the farmers, as they clustered
about Morgan and patted his round, deep body and
oblique shoulders.</p>

<p>The Coxcomb took his defeat ungracefully and having
settled his bets rode impatiently away with his friends.</p>

<h3>OLD GREY TELLS PIONEER TALES.</h3>


<p>Many events similar to the one related in the last
chapter spread the Morgan’s fame throughout the Valley,
and when Evans finished his clearing Justin Morgan once
more took possession of the horse, for his health was
sufficiently restored to take up school-teaching again.</p>

<p>The change from hard farm-work was very agreeable
to True, and they cantered from place to place right
gaily, albeit the horse missed the sweet singing of Master
Morgan, who coughed now incessantly, and often
had to dismount and rest in the shade of an oak on the
roadside.</p>

<p>He was scarce forty years old, but seemed much more
on account of his grievous malady.</p>

<p>Regularly they went to Royalton, some ten miles to
the southward, and True grazed about until school let
out. Through the window he sometimes saw the gentle,
delicate face of the teacher at his desk, his Continental
coat slightly open at the throat, showing a bit of fresh
white linen, his queue, in the fashion of the day, tied
with a stiff bow of black ribband.</p>

<p>He was a master of whom any horse might have been
proud.</p>

<p>One day, while waiting for his owner, True wandered
into the woods to escape the flies and dust of the highway,
and there he met his friend, Old Grey, who told
him how the Indians had burned Royalton in 1780; and

among the anecdotes relating to this time there was one
which amused the young horse no little.</p>

<p>It ran as follows:</p>

<p>For some unaccountable reason the Indians had failed
to burn the hut of one Jones, who had a wife known
far and wide as a scold and a shrew. To get a day’s
rest from her abuse, poor Jones oft-times had to go
hunting or trapping, and when he saw an especially bad
tantrum coming he would snatch his gun from the
mantel-shelf and, calling his dog, rush forth into the
forest, a storm of reviling in his wake. Sometimes he
remained away for days.</p>

<p>Nobody ever remembered having seen Jones smile.</p>

<p>One day, his wife’s temper and tongue being worse
than usual, he found it expedient to go hunting, and
stayed away over night. There are times when a silent
dog is sweet company and the peaceful forest a haven
of refuge.</p>

<p>On the second afternoon, thinking it might be safe to
return, Jones approached his home cautiously. Stranger
sounds than usual greeted his listening ear.</p>

<p>He paused, alert and intent, silencing his intelligent
dog with a gesture. Creeping stealthily forward under
the shadow of the trees, he beheld a small band of
Indians in the act of breaking open his hut-door. He
waited tensely, to see them drag his wife out and scalp
her.</p>

<p>Instead, from inside came her familiar voice raised in
vituperation and upbraiding. Jones could scarcely believe
his ears, and for the first time since his marriage
he grinned.</p>

<p>“This time those red imps have met their match,” he
murmured to his dog with an audible chuckle.</p>

<p>Hardly had he spoken when out came half a dozen
Indians dragging the shrew between them. Not for

one moment, however, did she cease her abuse, terrified
though she surely must have been.</p>

<p>Jones, standing at the edge of the forest, watched—&#8203;fearfully
at first, then with curious interest. Finally he
sat down on the ground and gave way to uncontrollable
mirth.</p>

<p>The Indians had paused on the river bank in consultation.</p>

<p>Suddenly, without warning apparently, two of them
gathered the scold in their arms and sprang into the
chill water. The others stood on the bank and whooped
mad encouragement, fiendishly, as only Indians can.</p>

<p>Mistress Jones’ green homespun petticoat filled quickly
with air and swelled around her like an enormous squash,
out of which her scarlet face glowed furiously.</p>

<p>The savages on the bank yelled and danced. Those
in the water ducked their victim up and down, howling
with glee, cracking her over the head as she rose.</p>

<p>“And there be some who say an Indian can’t see a
joke,” spluttered Jones, under his breath, holding his
sides. The dog looked at his master with suspicion—&#8203;he
thought the man was choking.</p>

<p>But Jones soon saw that the savages merely meant to
discipline his wife and give her a bath. An interruption
from him might disturb these laudable intentions, so he
remained quietly in the background.</p>

<p>When they had finished to their entire satisfaction
they lifted the woman out of the river and flung her,
gasping and shivering, among the tree-roots on the bank.
She looked like a huge wet log. Yelling, they swam the
river and disappeared in the dense woods beyond.</p>

<p>Trembling, Jones drew near—&#8203;his mirth turned to
seemly gravity; but he found a very subdued person.
Cautiously Mistress Jones opened her eyes, one at a
time, first peering carefully between the lids to see if

the approaching footsteps were those of her tormenters
returning.</p>

<p>When she saw her husband she groaned feebly.</p>

<p>“Have they gone?” she whispered.</p>

<p>“Yes,” replied Jones, with becoming seriousness.</p>

<p>Mistress Jones rose heavily, and squeezed the water
from her skirts, shaking, humble and sobered.</p>

<p>“It served me right, husband dear,” she wailed at last.
“I have ever been what those savages called me, ‘a dirty
blouze of a thing,’ but from now on I am a changed
woman and will be a better wife to you. The Indians
said they would teach me a lesson—&#8203;and they have!”

<h3>THE MORGAN GOES TO MONTPELIER TO LIVE.</h3>


<p>Sometimes Justin Morgan rode his horse to Williston
to visit his friend, the Hon. Lemuel Bottom, who was
a lover of good horses; sometimes they went to Hinesburgh,
a short distance from Burlington. They were
constantly on the go from one town to another, meeting
new people and horses and having fresh experiences.</p>

<p>Hinesburgh was a quiet little village, and, although
there were two saw-mills, they did not have “bees” as
they did at Randolph; the scenery was beautiful, and the
bedding so good that Morgan enjoyed his trips in spite
of the lack of excitement which he had grown to love at
Chase’s Mill.</p>

<p>His first military experience was when he took his
place under an empty saddle in the procession that conducted
the body of Col. Israel Converse to his grave.
Colonel Converse had been a brave soldier and greatly
beloved by his townspeople; over his open grave Morgan
heard for the first time a military salute and smelled the
acrid odor of gunpowder. For a long time he was
thrilled by the memory.</p>

<p>As time increased Master Morgan’s health declined
rapidly; in 1795-96 he grew too weak to work, and sold
his horse to one William Rice, of Woodstock, who in
turn sold him to Jonathan Shepard, a sturdy blacksmith
living in the little town of Montpelier.</p>

<p>Shepard was also landlord of the Farmer’s Inn, which
stood within a doughnut’s toss of his forge. He was

an energetic, thrifty man, and Colonel Davis engaged him
to do some clearing on his farm, seeing that he now had
a good strong young horse. Thus Morgan once more
became a farm-horse, but as Shepard was well to do and
kind, he fared well in his new home.</p>

<p>His dinner in a pail, and oats in a sack for the Morgan,
Shepard would go out for a day’s plowing or clearing
the while Mistress Shepard remained at home to serve
customers at the Inn.</p>

<p>A “halloo” from the forge would make the blacksmith
hurry back to aid a passing traveller whose horse had
cast a shoe or whose wagon or “shay” needed mending.
He would leave the Morgan in the care of Maximus
Fabius Davis, the son of Colonel Davis, who—&#8203;as boys
went, in Morgan’s estimation—&#8203;was pleasant enough.
Morgan was ever fond of men and women, already
grown, but the stage of childhood, required to
develop them into such, did not seem to interest him.</p>

<p>Now and again Maxy would ride him home in the
evening, and if there chanced to be a horse at the forge
anxious for a test, there would be a race or some trial
at pulling. Tales of his speed and strength spread for
miles around, and all who called at the Inn or the forge
were anxious to see him. But they always said afterward
it was a shame to turn such a fine animal into a
mere farm-horse. Shepard had his answer ready, that
he “was but a farmer himself, and needed a good plow-horse—&#8203;not
a racer eating its head off in his stable.”</p>

<p>Through honesty and that thrift for which the Vermonter
is famous Shepard soon acquired considerable
wealth, and wanting a larger place he exchanged the
Morgan, his smithy, and the Farmers’ Inn for the large
farm on Dog River, belonging to James Hawkins. Thus,
Morgan changed owners, but not homes, for Hawkins
came to Montpelier to live. The horse was glad of this,

for he liked the musical ring of the hammer on the anvil
and the glare of the forge as the handle of the bellows
was raised and lowered.</p>

<p>Montpelier, organized in 1793, was a village of little
consequence, but one of its citizens was a man of parts,
staunch and true, and destined to rise to the high position
of Secretary of State. His name was David Wing,
Jr., and he often borrowed the Morgan from Hawkins
for as much as a week at a time. Under the comfortable
saddle of Master Wing, Morgan first saw the beautiful
Winooski, with its sweep of eddies and currents, its
foaming rapids and singing falls. David loved nature
and good scenery as much as Morgan and their trips
were sweet and pleasant through lovely, fertile valleys
and across densely wooded hills; along frequented highways
or vague trails through the forests.</p>

<p>Sometimes they went as far as Burlington and Morgan
had to cross many streams and wade through foaming,
circling water, which, when very deep, gave him a
sense of adventure. He was always ready to swim if
the need came, and would have hesitated at nothing his
rider set him to do, such confidence did he feel in Man-wisdom.</p>

<p>If they were not in a hurry David would allow him to
play along the way, knowing well enough the horse
would not abuse the privilege. He rode with a loose
rein, and on the way home would let the Morgan choose
his own gait and trail. The firm touch on the bridle
was as light as a woman’s, but Morgan was not fooled
by it. He well knew this was a rider who would brook
no impertinence, and it kept him steady and respectful,
even while he took advantage of the permission to frolic
a little.</p>

<p>These two saw many strange sights in their wanderings—&#8203;sights

that later history proved were the making
of a fine and sturdy race of men and horses.</p>

<p>Ofttimes, in bitter winter weather, they passed little
bare-foot children on their way to school, carrying their
shoes in their cold hands, to put on, in a very elegant
manner, at the school-house door; to <em>walk</em> in them would
have been <em>wilful extravagance</em>, though their toes were
blue with cold! If, by chance, they found a cow lying
down, chewing on her morning cud, they would disturb
her rudely and make her get up, that they might put
their bare feet on the spot she had so nicely warmed
for her own comfort.</p>

<p>But better and more prosperous times were coming,
and it was not long before shoes were looked upon as a
necessity for children, not an extravagance, though they
were ever evil-smelling things—&#8203;the leather being home-tanned
and home-cured and needing much greasing at
night to keep it soft enough to make the shoes wearable.
They made an unseemly clumping on the floor, and were
very ugly, but their aim being use, not beauty, this was
no drawback.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>Sometimes kind and gentle Mistress Hannah Wing
rode the Morgan to a quilting bee, or meeting, or to such
entertainments as ladies saw fit to attend. She was
good to him and made his visits to their barn most
pleasant. In the mornings she would come tripping out,
her arms full of dew-wet clover or grass, just cut, or
she would have a dish of goodies from the kitchen—&#8203;some
carrots or turnips. ’Twas no wonder the horse
loved her and called to her, as she drew near, with his
affectionate little neigh. He always hoped David might
buy him from Hawkins; he loved the Wings and they
returned his friendship. And a horse never knows

when he may change owners. He can only hope his next
one may be the one of his choosing, which does sometimes
happen.</p>

<p>The minds of the Vermonters in those days dwelt on
higher things than fashions, especially with the men, and
the wearing of beavers was not common, unless perhaps
the hat was inherited. Hats were so much better made
then, and so expensive, that a beaver lasted from thirty
to forty years, and was passed on from father to son. In
this way it had come to be looked on as frivolous and
extravagant to be seen in a new one; if any man had
the courage to buy such, he left it out in the weather a
few nights to “<em>take that new look off</em>” before he wore
it in public.</p>

<p>At this time David Wing was town-clerk, and one
day on his return from a trip to Boston, by stage, he
brought home something in what was unmistakably a hatbox.</p>

<p>Gossip concerning so important a man soon flew about,
and the box became town-talk before the day was over.
Women folks came, on one pretext or another, to call
on Mistress Wing. Some asked her rule for wheaten
cake, others how she made her cheeses, and so on. But
it did not take their clever hostess long to find out the
true aim of their calls, and being right proud of the hat
herself, she took it out of the box and showed it to them
all. ’Twas very tall and glossy, and shaped liked the
rain barrel; the brim was so low in front it would hide
its wearer’s nose completely; suddenly it curved sharply
at the sides in the manner of a drawn bow; and, all
told, it was an elegant bit of the latest Boston fashion.</p>

<p>’Twas to be worn, Mistress Wing informed her callers,
for the first time at meeting the next Sabbath.</p>

<p>Many were the exclamations of “Land sakes!” and
“Do tells!” that the sight of the hat provoked, and much

pleased was Mistress Hannah to be able to awaken so
much admiration for her husband’s taste.</p>

<p>Unfortunately David did not wait until the Sabbath
to wear his new hat; had he done so history, in all likelihood,
would never have recorded the fact that he had
owned a beaver.</p>

<p>The very next morning he came swinging out of the
house looking most gentlemanly in his high stock, ruffled
shirt and shining boots. On his head sat, most jauntily,
the new hat.</p>

<p>David was off for a town meeting.</p>

<p>Down the road cantered Morgan, meeting many acquaintances
who paused in speechless admiration until
they passed out of sight. Some with envy, alack; some
with criticism of the extravagance, but others with
friendly nod of greeting and approval.</p>

<p>The sun shone, the crisp air was fragrant with pine
needles, and birds chirped in the trees that fringed the
highway. Morgan champed his bit and curvetted from
one side of the road to the other, his heart full of the
morning freshness.</p>

<p>Suddenly a yellow dog came in sight, and the horse,
full of fun and spirit, lowered his head and made a dash
at him, remembering his colt-days and the game of
“Red-Coats.” The dog tucked his tail between his hind legs
and made off down the road at lightning speed.</p>

<p>This was enough to rouse Morgan; even though he
did not like dogs, he thought it might be a race. Helter,
skelter, he started; ever fleet in running, he was soon
gaining slowly, but surely, on the dog, who was little
more than a yellowish brown streak on the landscape.</p>

<p>Morgan heard David say, good-naturedly:</p>

<p>“Go it, my boy, stop when you get good and ready; I
am having as much fun as you.”</p>

<p>Once, as the dog glanced hurriedly back over his

shoulder, the horse saw his tongue hanging out—&#8203;he
looked almost winded, but his pace was long and even,
like Morgan’s, and his flapping ears responded rhythmically
to his gait.</p>

<p>Morgan tossed his head and made a movement with
his tail as much as to indicate he had just begun to race.
The rapid clatter of his own hoofs on the hard road was
music to him.</p>

<p>Seconds passed. Then the dog disappeared at a sharp
bend in the road.</p>

<p>Losing sight of him for a moment nerved Morgan
to a sudden spurt. With all his power impelling him he,
too, rounded the corner—&#8203;and ran headlong into two
horsemen who had been jogging peacefully and unsuspectingly
along the quiet and seemingly deserted highway.</p>

<p>What a reckoning there was! Never was such confusion!
Lawyer Buckley slid from the back of his pony
and his books broke from the strap and were scattered
over the road; Dr. Pierce’s saddle bags burst open and
pills and bandages fell out as if to offer their help in the
emergency.</p>

<p>Morgan, realizing he had caused all the trouble, kept
his presence of mind admirably, and stood firm and
motionless where his front feet had plowed into the
earth at his sudden halt. David did not lose his seat,
but the stop, without any warning, almost threw him
over Morgan’s head.</p>

<p>When things had steadied a bit, and explanations and
apologies made, David noticed for the first time, as he
put his hand up to remove his hat, and wipe the perspiration
from his brow, that his beaver was missing.</p>

<p>Under the very feet of Dr. Pierce’s nag, who stood
still snorting her expostulations, it was found. Lawyer

Buckley picked it up, shaking his head with ill-concealed
satisfaction.</p>

<p>“’Tis but a crushed and torn rag,” he said, brushing
it the wrong way with the sleeve of his coat; “but you
have that young Morgan to thank for the prank.”</p>

<p>At these words Morgan was more mortified than ever,
though he could not help glancing furtively about for
the dog and pricking his ears back and forth for sounds.
Soon he espied and heard him a short way ahead,
yelping from the cover of his owner’s hut, surrounded
by a protecting and gaping crowd of small bare-foot
children who had assembled from the other side of the
house to find out what the matter was.</p>

<p>It is not necessary to relate with what fallen crest
Morgan bore his rider home after the day closed in.
The hat, so lately the envy of the whole town, hidden
under his rider’s coat, to be laid away until Mistress
Hannah could restore it to some of its first magnificence.

<h3>MORGAN MAKES A TRIP TO BOSTON.</h3>


<p>For several days Morgan showed his regret at the
fate of the beaver by neither romping nor playing.
When David and himself were on their way from place
to place and resting at noon, he cropped grass in a very
staid and dignified manner, whilst David sat in the shade
and ate his luncheon of light wheaten cakes and cheese,
the two things for which Mistress Hannah was famous.</p>

<p>On these trips they sometimes met the Boston-Canada
stage coaches, carrying the mail, and they would stand
one side and watch the horses running at full speed over
the rough roads; the horn winding a lusty warning to
private coach, curricle or rider, that might be approaching
from the other direction round a sharp bend in the
way.</p>

<p>Again they would pass lazy oxen, drawing their sleds
slowly to market, or coming home from mill, their loads
creaking behind them as they swayed awkwardly from
side to side, responding reluctantly to the goad-sticks in
their drivers’ hands.</p>

<p>These pioneer teams drew the products of the outlying
farms—&#8203;maple sugar, and potash and “black salts”—&#8203;(gathered
by thrifty farmers from the ashes of winter
fires or logging heaps)—&#8203;to the towns.</p>

<p>The forests of Vermont at first were gloomy and almost
impenetrable, tending, some claimed, to make the
people grave and serious, but already the lumber industry
had begun the destruction of the beautiful woods of

hemlock, birch, white pine, ash, chestnut and stately oak.
Saw-mills whirred and sang busily on river banks, whose
falls afforded such marvellous water-power for their
wheels, and comfortable houses soon took the place of
pioneer huts in many places.</p>

<p>In spite of his faithful service to the Wings, they did
not buy the Morgan, and Hawkins after a while sold
him to the same Robert Evans, at Randolph, for whom
he had once done such good service.</p>

<p>Randolph had a newspaper now, called <cite>The Weekly
Wanderer</cite>, and this praised the Morgan so highly that
for a while, out of pride, Evans had to keep him in good
condition. But unfortunately this pride lasted but a
short time, Evans being too busy at his farm work and
trapping, earning a living for his family.</p>

<p>On the day of his return to Randolph, Morgan heard
that Master Justin Morgan had gone on to “lie in green
pastures, beside still waters.” So sweet a sound had
this to the lonely horse, separated from his good friends
in Montpelier, that he sometimes wandered away from
the Evans’ primitive barn, looking for that “Valley of
the Shadow” of which men spoke when referring to the
kindly school-master. The heat of the mid-summer days
sometimes oppressed the little horse, and he grew thin
and weary at the plow, but there was no “Valley of the
Shadow” for him—&#8203;no other valley could he find than his
work-a-day one along the banks of the sparkling White
River in full sunshine.</p>

<p>In the weary battling against the uncongenial farm
life, he was no little cheered by the memory of what his
father told him of his high-crested ancestor, the Godolphin
Arabian—&#8203;that he, in all his greatness and beauty,
had once pulled a water cart in France.</p>

<p>In a year the brave little horse was unrecognizable;
his once glossy, soft coat had coarsened, and often he

was humiliated by the knowledge that there were burrs
in his tail and in the bit of dark hair that grew above his
fetlocks.</p>

<p>Chase’s Mill was still the centre of the town’s gaiety;
occasionally there were races, but rarely were the horses
worth Morgan’s effort.</p>

<p>In spring, when the world was full of flowers, and
orchids and blue flags hung their banners out to tempt
the Evans children into the woods, Morgan would go
with them to gather these or the more useful medicinal
herbs for times of sickness—&#8203;pleurisy-root, marshmallow
or ginseng. In summer he went with them to pick berries
of all sorts or wild grapes, and when the autumn
came, with its glory of beech and maple, turning to
copper and scarlet, he would bring home their bags of
nuts across his round back.</p>

<p>In winter his coat grew long and thick; and Evans
himself rode him to distant traps set in the forest for
bear, musk-rat and foxes, which supplied food or clothing
for the family. The horse grew accustomed after
a while to the monotony of his life and tried to make the
best of it.</p>

<p>One cold, clear day Evans cleaned him so very carefully
Morgan felt sure something was about to happen,
but did not try to guess what; he had learned the futility
of that long ago, for things never came about as he
guessed or planned they should.</p>

<p>In the course of time, however, he found himself cantering
along the stage-road to Boston. It was a trip
he had long wanted to take, so many horses had told
him what a beautiful and gay city it was.</p>

<p>The day being severely cold, he was glad enough of
the long legs and homespun woolen breeches of his rider
which covered so much of his sides. As for Evans, he
had his muskrat cap pulled well over his ears and his

home-made boots of calf-skin (smelling horribly of
grease), with the heavy breeches tucked well inside,
were warm and comfortable to his feet.</p>

<p>But they must have cut a sorry figure when they
reached Boston and went along Summer Street; that
lovely, fashionable thoroughfare, with its stately trees,
beautiful flower gardens and splendid mansions.</p>

<p>It was dusk when they stopped in Corn Court, at the
Braser Inn—&#8203;the famous hostelry opened by Samuel
Cole, in 1634, where Miantonomah’s painted Indians—&#8203;envoys
to Sir Harry Vane—&#8203;had been entertained; where
the French Premier, Talleyrand, had so lately stayed;
where so many other events of history had taken place.</p>

<p>As Evans was hitching his horse to a post near the
side door of the tavern, Morgan heard a familiar, bantering
voice; the odor of musk came to his nostrils
faintly, and glancing about, he saw—&#8203;as he knew he
should—&#8203;the Coxcomb.</p>

<p>No fop of the King’s court could have looked more
elegant; his Continental coat, cocked hat and high shining
boots were of the latest cut—&#8203;not less offensive to
the simple taste of the horse was his insolent swagger.</p>

<p>Master Knickerbocker, of course, did not notice Morgan,
but cried to Evans persuadingly:</p>

<p>“Tarry the night, my Green Mountain Giant, we can
show you rare sport at cards if you’ve money in your
purse.”</p>

<p>Evans towered above the popinjay as his Green Mountains
would have towered over Beacon Hill. He gazed
down at him with contempt, vaguely, yet not definitely,
recognizing his one-time antagonist in a race, as Morgan
had.</p>

<p>“I have no money to lose to you, my young sir,” he
made reply, ungraciously. “I am but a simple farmer,

and I play with none but my own kind. I do not know
the rules by which such as you handle the cards!”</p>

<p>“Then join us in a glass of Medford rum—&#8203;such as you
Vermonters know so well how to appreciate—&#8203;’tis cold
outside and the landlord will mull us a bowl. Come,
I say!”</p>

<p>He clapped the farmer hospitably on the shoulder in
friendly fashion, and led the way into the tavern.</p>

<p>A kind bar-maid came out and threw a fur square
over Morgan’s shivering back and give him a warm
mash, which comforted him greatly. He acknowledged
her friendliness, by nipping her sleeve gently with his
lip; and as she was fond of horses, this pleased her,
and she further brought him joy by patting his face
gently and murmuring little love-talk in his ears.</p>

<p>Many hours later the side door opened and the Coxcomb
came out. He was talking to himself as he closed
the door behind him, blotting out the sudden radiance
from the great, roaring fire inside the tavern. He did
not notice Morgan, though he almost touched him in the
darkness as he paced to and fro.</p>

<p>“Egad!” he cried, under his breath; “the fellow had
money—&#8203;but he has it not. Let him go back where he
belongs, to his land of hemlock and frost-bitten, half-civilized
race…. Yet,” and he almost sighed—&#8203;not
quite, “even <em>I</em> awakened to a slight feeling of compunction
when he turned out the toe of a woman’s stocking
and confessed it was his last shilling—&#8203;money, he
remembered too late, his wife had given him to buy a
calico gown…. Ha! Calico, at the trifle of
three shillings the yard! Mistress Lloyd”—&#8203;here Morgan
pricked his ears back and forth—&#8203;“Mistress Lloyd
wears silks and satins, and her laces are like cobwebs….
Oddsbodikins! <em>There</em> is a maid to turn a man’s
head—&#8203;even mine! ’Twill not be long now before my

suit prospers…. I have won everything from her
father but his daughter, and I shall bide my time till I
win her. I have made up my mind—&#8203;I, and not Dulaney,
will live ‘Where the Great Lloyd sets his Hall!’”</p>

<p>Almost under Morgan’s nose he drew from his satin
waistcoat-pocket a snuff-box wrought in gold by a master
craftsman. With the tips of his delicate fingers he
daintily pinched a few grains of the evil-smelling powder
and placed it to his nostrils.</p>

<p>Morgan sneezed.</p>

<p>The Coxcomb stepped hurriedly aside with a prodigious
oath as the door of the Inn swung open.</p>

<p>Robert Evans stalked out into the night, his cap
pulled over his ears, his fur cape wrapped tight about
his shoulders. The Coxcomb greeted him with a condescending
smile and extended his snuff-box.</p>

<p>The giant waved it aside with a gesture of dignity and
scorn.</p>

<p>“No, sir,” he said, shortly; “if the good Lord had
intended my nose for a dirt-box, he would have put it
on upside down!”</p>

<p>Master Knickerbocker laughed, though Evans had
not intended to be funny.</p>

<p>“Egad! A very good sally!” he drawled. “Yet I but
tried to show my friendliness.”</p>

<p>“’Tis a pity you had not tried to show it earlier in
the evening,” returned Evans, gruffly, as he mounted
his horse and rode away.</p>

<p>Good Dame Evans would have no calico gown from
Boston, that was sure, and ’twas money she’d saved for
years from her cheese and butter sales, and kept in an
old bee-hive in the attic, saying no word to anyone of it.</p>

<p>Now her sacrifices had gone to purchase snuff and
perfume for the Coxcomb.</p>
<br>

 <p class="caption">“‘WHERE THE GREAT LLOYD SETS HIS HALL’!”</p>
</div><!--end figcenter-->
<br>

<p>Morgan had often seen Dame Evans give the traditional
Vermont “beech seal” to her sons—&#8203;and he would
not deny they needed it; and he had seen her dash scalding
water on a prowling Indian; he guessed Robert
Evans’ greeting, when they reached home, would not be
an affectionate one.</p>

<p>On the way back to Randolph, Evans was in a temper
and swore grievously. Morgan had caught a cold and
coughed constantly. The journey was withal a trying
one; ’twas not to be wondered at that the horse’s memories
of Boston were neither beautiful nor gay, and that
he never had a desire to repeat his trip.</p>

<p>It was dark when they reached home, but Mistress
Evans, who had been on the lookout, threw open the
kitchen door as they entered the gate, and the barnyard
was flooded with the warm glow of the firelight
from within. Her head was tied up in a fustian square
and a fur was thrown over her shoulders. She ran out
to greet them, a lanthorn in her hand.</p>

<p>“Welcome, home, Husband, dear!” she cried, cheerily.
“Give me the purchases. I would see my calico frock
without delay. Yes, and get to work on it, for ’tis no
short task to stitch those long seams—&#8203;with chores to do
besides!”</p>

<p>She held out her hand eagerly.</p>

<p>“Go into the house directly, Wife, out of the cold!”
evaded Evans, taking the lanthorn from her. “I will
be in presently—&#8203;when I have bedded down the Morgan,”
he added.</p>

<p>And she, being an obedient, womanly and faithful wife,
suspecting nothing, went in to sing over the final preparations
of supper.</p>

<p>In spite of the cold and fatigue of his owner, Morgan
never got a better rubbing-down nor a finer meal.</p>

<p>“Well, Morgan,” Evans murmured, at last, “I guess
I can’t put it off any longer.”
</p>

<p>He dragged his reluctant feet slowly toward the house,
where Dame Evans was waiting for him with steaming
hulled corn, fried pork and maybe something else—&#8203;when
she found out his secret!

<h3>FOR MISTRESS LLOYD, OF MARYLAND.</h3>


<p>In 1803 Morgan went to pass a week with his old
friends, the Wings, and the visit was one long to be
remembered.</p>

<p>The talk of the village was Mistress Hannah’s new
silken gown—&#8203;the first ever brought to Montpelier, so the
town history tells. David Wing was now Judge and
Secretary of State, and his wife had to wear fine
clothes, as befitted her station, for many were the calls
on her to entertain distinguished guests.</p>

<p>It was at a meeting in their new barn that Mistress
Wing first wore the wonderful silk. All the other ladies
present had on homespun and linen—&#8203;silk would have
been called “flunk and flummux” on them.</p>

<p>The Judge that day wore his Indian cotton shirt with
the frills—&#8203;hemmed and tucked. It made a brave show,
for cotton was three shillings the yard at that time.</p>

<p>I mention these historic facts merely to show that
Morgan played his part with the Quality of the times, as
well as at the plow, and to occupy a stall in the Judge’s
grand new barn was no small privilege to a horse!</p>

<p>But the greatest pleasure of all was when he heard
that Colonel Lloyd of Maryland, and his daughter had
come a’visiting the Judge and his lady.</p>

<p>The Wings and the Lloyds had met in New York the
winter before and the Judge had unwoven some legal
tangles for the Colonel. A friendship had resulted and
now the Southerners had come all the way from Maryland

in their coach to enjoy the cool, summer breezes of
Vermont under the hospitable roof of their New England
friends.</p>

<p>When the Judge brought them out to see his new barn
Morgan recognized the swish of her petticoats at once,
as Mistress Lloyd drew near the stable.</p>

<p>Knowing how they loved good horses their host threw
open Morgan’s door.</p>

<p>There was an instant’s pause, then:</p>

<p>“Why, I <em>know</em> this horse!” cried Mistress Lloyd. “<em>I</em>
gave him his first blue ribband!”</p>

<p>Oh, the melody of her voice, and the feel of her cheek
against his! At last, after years of parting, they met—&#8203;and
she had not forgotten him. Oh, wondrous memory
of such a woman as she!</p>

<p>Morgan was glad the Judge’s hired man had groomed
him so carefully that morning, and that not long before,
the stable floor had been strewn with fresh, sweet sawdust.</p>

<p>“What a noble animal you’ve grown to be!” she whispered
in his waiting ear. “I predicted it full ten years
agone!”</p>

<p>So it had been ten years since he had seen her last, yet
he had cherished her, and she him, in memory, all that
long time of busy scenes apart.</p>

<p>He pushed his small muzzle in and out among the laces
and gauzes of her neck so gently they were not disarranged,
and she pressed her cheek close to his. Something
in the tones of her voice told him she was not
happy, and as the delicious odor of her hair entered his
nostrils he whinneyed a question, softly.</p>

<p>As if understanding, she answered, murmuring near
his ear,</p>

<p>“Dear Little Horse,” there was a catch in her voice, “I
cannot buy you, even now, for our money is all gone!

Daddy is no manager; he has ever been what they call a
‘gentleman’ and our family mansion—&#8203;‘where the Great
Lloyd sets his Hall’—&#8203;is to be sold to pay a most unjust
‘debt of honor’—&#8203;I call it a debt of <em>dis</em>honor, for ’twas
made at the gaming table; and though Judge Wing be
ever so clever, he can do nothing now for my father and
me!”</p>

<p>She leaned against Morgan; he heard a sob in her
throat as she clasped his arched neck.</p>

<p>He whinneyed his tenderest sympathy, and maybe she
would have told him more, but there came a sound of
voices through the open door.</p>

<p>“Ah, here you are, my daughter!” It was the Colonel
speaking. “Come and greet our friend who has ridden
all the way from Boston to see us. He says he has a
plan whereby we may save our home!” Colonel Lloyd
spoke hopefully, if a little doubtfully.</p>

<p>Mistress Lloyd turned her face, flushed with emotion,
and saw the Coxcomb, of whom Morgan had just caught
scent.</p>

<p>“A plan?” she questioned him, after a cold greeting.
“You mean a price! ’Tis the same old one,” she said
wearily, “I do not need to be told!”</p>

<p>“My price,” he answered, shrugging his shoulders, “is
offered out of friendship for your father <span class="lock">and—”</span></p>

<p>“You need not say!” she interrupted him, contemptuously.
“’Tis not for <em>friendship</em> you do kindnesses!”</p>

<p>“You know my price,” he said, with calm insolence.
“I have waited long,” he added, under his breath.</p>

<p>“I will never pay it!” she replied with steady scorn,
but so firmly Master Knickerbocker could not but believe
her.</p>

<p>The truth was, he wanted her to be his wife, and she,
knowing what manner of man he was, had withstood his
importunities for years. She would none of him.
</p>

<p>She held her head high.</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and raised his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“As you will, Mistress! In one week more you and
your father will be beggars, and living on the charity of
your friends—&#8203;unless?” He flicked his riding boot with
his whip and looked at her with defiance.</p>

<p>There was a short silence during which the lady grew
very haughty, and then began to move away.</p>

<p>“Come,” the Coxcomb spoke again, in a different tone,
following after her. “You love a good race—&#8203;you’re a
Southerner—&#8203;what say you to a <em>race</em>—&#8203;<em>yourself and your
home</em> the stake? If you win I will cancel all these
notes I hold against your father and accept your refusal
to marry me as final. If I win, <span class="lock">ah——”</span></p>

<p>Mistress Lloyd silenced him with a movement; she
was no longer the slip of a girl True knew at Hartford.
Here was a mature character of spirit and dignity, yet
not lacking in the sweetness of perfect womanhood.</p>

<p>“I understand—&#8203;you need not put the rest in words. I
will <em>ride</em> your race, <em>on this very horse</em>—&#8203;and you?”</p>

<p>“I have Silvertail with me,” he answered, and in an
undertone added, “You will not have the ghost of a
chance!”</p>

<p>If Mistress Lloyd did not hear this, Morgan did, and
switched his tail with satisfaction, moving his ears to
and fro, to miss nothing.</p>

<p>Silvertail! If horses could laugh aloud, Morgan
would have laughed. He recalled a race six years before
against Silvertail and it seemed almost a miracle
that he should meet him again—&#8203;of all the other horses
in America—&#8203;in so important an event.</p>

<p>“I am not afraid of Silvertail,” came Mistress Lloyd’s
brave reply.</p>

<p>The Coxcomb looked at Morgan scornfully, not remembering

how he, too, had been defeated by him years
ago, at Chase’s Mill!</p>

<p>“Then ’tis settled,” he said, confidently.</p>

<p>“Nay, not settled!” cried the lady, with well-feigned
gaiety. “We’ve yet to put the matter in writing, all in
due form with the Judge to advise.” For Mistress
Lloyd was no careless person, when it came to business,
nor no mean reader of men.</p>

<p>She placed her hand for a moment under Morgan’s
jaw and felt his pulses surge in response to her touch;
then she drew herself erect, reassured—&#8203;as if the race
were already won!</p>

<p>They left the stable making their plans.</p>

<p>An hour later, Judge Wing and the Colonel came into
the Morgan’s stall.</p>

<p>“My dear sir,” the Colonel was saying, “the folly of
it! My daughter—&#8203;and to ride for such a stake! But
you know the girl. She has set her heart on it—&#8203;I can
do nothing. She winds me about her finger as if I were
a piece of string, since her dear mother died. Our
trouble is all my fault, what with mortgages and debts
of honor, I am well paid for my follies—&#8203;and, after all,
this race is better than seeing her married to the author
of all our unhappiness. Yet if she should not win!”</p>

<p>“No need to worry over that, my friend,” the Judge
said. “Morgan has already beaten this Silvertail horse.”</p>

<p>“You don’t tell me!”</p>

<p>“I recall the circumstances perfectly,” continued the
Judge. “Silvertail<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> is a horse with a reputation; he was
bred in St. Lawrence County, New York, and the Morgan
once won a stake of fifty dollars in a race against
him. It was in the life-time of Justin Morgan himself,
and Master Morgan, sir, offered Silvertail two chances
to redeem himself afterwards, in either walking or running,

but the offer was declined. The world doesn’t
know Morgan, but I do, and our race is already won!”</p>

<p>The horse arched his crest at these words of praise.</p>

<p>“Then all is said!” cried the Colonel, in a tone of relief.
“My daughter is the finest horse-woman in Maryland,
and that is no mean praise.”</p>

<p>He came to Morgan and placed his hand lightly on
the horse’s broad forehead, and seeing the Judge had
turned away, spoke softly near the pricking ear.</p>

<p>“Save her, Little Horse, and I will never touch another
card!”</p>

<p>Already Morgan could feel the finish of that race and
see the flaxen-maned Silvertail toiling behind. He had
little regard for a horse with light points (but which do
well enough for mere beauty); deep in his heart his
respect was for dark points, at once indicating possibilities
of strength, docility and endurance—&#8203;he had
<em>proven</em> these qualities and knew!</p>

<p>That afternoon, the sun still high, he was led out to
be exercised and prepared for the race.</p>

<p>Then She came, and, mounting him, rode easily and
gaily down the stretch of road to the blacksmith shop
where the course, as usual, was marked out along the
highway.</p>

<p>In the fashion of the day her purple habit almost
swept the ground as she sat her saddle with firm confidence;
her wide hat and plume falling to her shoulders,
framed her high-bred face. Her eyes sparkled—&#8203;for the
moment she almost seemed to have forgotten the nature
of the stake! Hers was the embodiment of that Southern
spirit of which Beautiful Bay had so often told True.</p>

<p>Her grasp of the bridle rein was as gentle as a caress,
but as firm as steel—&#8203;showing, well, she would brook no
foolishness from a horse.</p>

<p>Against the sky the Green Mountains reared their

heads, the pastureland on their sloping sides was patched
here and there with cloud-shadows, and, where the sun’s
rays slanted on the Winooski it glittered like a silver
line in the valley. No wind, and a late rain, made the
condition of the road perfect.</p>

<p>Loitering about the smithy were a few men who
roused themselves at sight of the Morgan cantering up
with a lady on his back.</p>

<p>Across the way, on the Inn porch, the sound of voices
rose and fell in argument over the policies of Thomas
Jefferson, the “Farmer” President; the purchase of Louisiana
from the French, and such topics of the time.
The idle men to whom the voices belonged sat in a row,
their chairs tilted against the wall, but when they saw
the Coxcomb swagger forth, they brought them down to
the floor, simultaneously, and stared curiously.</p>

<p>Silvertail was led up and the slender New Yorker
swung himself lightly into the saddle.</p>

<p>The idlers rose, gazed after the retreating horseman a
moment, then strode with one accord down the Inn steps
and on to the smithy, just in time to see the Coxcomb
give Mistress Lloyd a grand sweep of his hat, as he said
gallantly:</p>

<p>“’Tis hard to beat so fair an antagonist, but the stake
is one I must win!”</p>

<p>“The race is yet to be run!” the lady made reply,
smiling, securely.</p>

<p>She released the fastenings of her plumed hat and
tossed it to her father.</p>

<p>“Catch, Daddy, dear! I ride with no frills and furbelows
to-day! I wish I were that light Francis Buckle.
Do you recall, Father, how he won last year at Epsom
on Tyrant, the very worst horse that ever won a
Derby?”</p>

<p>“My daughter is almost as light as Buckle and the

Morgan a better horse. We have nothing to fear!” So
spoke Colonel Lloyd, bravely, and, patting Morgan’s
long shoulder, he raised his hat with courtly grace and
bade his daughter, “God-speed!” right gaily.</p>

<p>And Mistress Lloyd? She laughed serenely—&#8203;that
same brook-like laugh of long ago; her lip did not
quiver nor her voice tremble. With such spirit do men
go into battle. She gathered the reins in her slim, bare
hands—&#8203;no gloves should come between her and Morgan’s
mouth that day—&#8203;and smiled at her antagonist, as
if to say:</p>

<p>“Morgan and I do not fear you and Silvertail!”</p>

<p>When Silvertail recognized Morgan, which he did at
once, he began to fret and prance. Morgan, however,
made no false motions; he was saving every fibre of
energy. With eager nostrils and arching crest he
waited the signal to start.</p>

<p>The Coxcomb sat his horse with consummate grace,
but his eyes glittered cruelly, in a way that boded ill for
Silvertail. In his hand he carried a silver-mounted
whip, on his heels spurs shone.</p>

<p>Mistress Lloyd, on the other hand, had neither whip
nor spur; she ever depended on the tones of her voice
for success with horses; sitting like a model for an Amazon,
she waited, calm, serene.</p>

<p>A furtive backward glance from Silvertail’s eye said
plainly enough, “For less than a carrot I’d bolt, to get
out of this race!”</p>

<p>Once Morgan quivered as he remembered what his
father had told him of Eclipse: “Eclipse first, the rest
nowhere!”</p>

<p>To-day it should be “Morgan first, Silvertail nowhere!”
The breeze blew lightly at his mane, his eyes
glowed, his neck strained as the signal was given.</p>

<p>Morgan leaped forward. They were off!
</p>

<p>Swift, as one of a race divine who flies, rather than
treads the earth, Morgan’s deep, wide chest cleaved the
air.</p>

<p>Pressing close came Silvertail, breathing heavily.</p>

<p>Mistress Lloyd had given Morgan his head, with intimate
trust and understanding. He would win—&#8203;in his
own way—&#8203;and she knew it. She was low in the saddle,
leaning close to his extended neck, pressing her knees
against his side. In a tender, restrained voice she whispered,
almost in his ear:</p>

<p>“Win, my beauty! Win me my soldier at West
Point! Win me my love, my home, my father, and my
freedom from the persecutions of this man! Fly on!
Fly on, you ‘Bird of the Desert’! Win, and Allah will
bless you!”</p>

<p>She was stretched like an Indian along the back of
her running horse.</p>

<p>Then—&#8203;there they were at the end of the course, Morgan
a full length ahead of Silvertail!</p>

<p>In an instant she was off and had buried her face in
Morgan’s mane; she was sobbing and laughing all at
once, with her arms close about the horse’s neck, as if
she would never let him go!</p>

<p>Silvertail came up, a small spot of blood showing on
his side where the cruel spur had wounded him.</p>

<p>Master Knickerbocker drew from his pocket a packet
of papers, taking his defeat outwardly in better part than
might have been expected.</p>

<p>“You have won, ma’am,” he said in a low, hoarse
voice, for he had much to do to control himself. “You
have won, and that right fairly. I could have wished it
otherwise, nor do I <em>yet</em> see how ’twas done! Your horse
was better than mine, I suppose; and now I shall bid
you good-bye, forever.”</p>

<p>Mistress Lloyd took the packet in her trembling fingers;

with her face still screened behind the Morgan, she
said gently,</p>

<p>“Nay, but I must thank you for <span class="lock">these——”</span></p>

<p>But she was interrupted, brusquely:</p>

<p>“There is naught to thank me for,” he said, with truth.
“Thank that Canadian scrub of yours. Since the race is
over methinks I have tried conclusions with him before,
many years back when we were both younger; I shall
look to it that I am not deceived into competing with
him again! That horse ought to be on The Plains of
Abraham; he is wasted here!”</p>

<p>Mistress Lloyd extended her hand across the Morgan’s
neck, and Master Knickerbocker raised it to his lips with
his usual grace; then he swung himself into his saddle
and galloped out of sight.</p>

<h3>IN WHICH MORGAN IS KNOWN AS THE GOSS HORSE.</h3>


<p>Soon after his race with Silvertail, Morgan’s reputation,
having spread so far, he was bought by Colonel
John Goss, who, not caring to have the trouble of a
horse himself, rode him over to St. Johnsbury, and
loaned him to David Goss.</p>

<p>When they arrived it was the eve of Training Day,
the second of June, and many farmers were gathered
and making merry at the tavern. Having all heard of
the Morgan, a great sensation was created as Colonel
Goss rode him up to the porch of the Inn to show him
off after Abel Shorey had trimmed and rubbed him
down.</p>

<p>He had cantered gaily up—&#8203;mane and tail waving, wide
nostrils tremulous at new scents, alert ears pricking for
new sounds.</p>

<p>Later he was ridden to his stable in David Goss’s barn.
The Goss place was a fine one, with large farmhouse,
barn and outbuildings, the whole being surrounded by
tall and stately trees.</p>

<p>It was a beautiful home for a horse to claim, and it
was to be Morgan’s for a long time. Here his name was
changed again, and he became known as the Goss Horse,
and was valued at one hundred dollars.</p>

<p>Under David’s saddle he travelled more than ever to
near-by towns and farms; he went to East Bethel, Williamstown,
Greensboro and Claremont. In all of these

places he was made welcome and, for a hundred years
and more, men have been telling of these visits.</p>

<p>Sometimes David rode him to “raising parties,” where
he stood one side and watched strong young men lift
the ponderous bents for the barn or house about to be
built. They used pike-poles, and shouted loudly, lifting
the bents one by one till the tenons sank into place in
the sill-mortises; then, some dare-devil afraid-of-nothing,
went up the new-hoisted bents like a squirrel and drove
the pins into place.</p>

<p>While men worked this way, or at the plow, women
sat at home and dipped candles or spun and wove flax
and wool, and made them into clothes.</p>

<p>Those were grand days in Vermont—&#8203;when neighbors
were neighbors, and the world was full of hope and
kindliness.</p>

<p>At this time Samuel Goss owned a newspaper called
<cite>The Montpelier Watchman</cite>, and in its columns could be
found notices of the endurance, beauty and gentleness
of the Goss—&#8203;but far from turning his level head, it only
made him strive harder to deserve the praise. Modestly
and cheerfully he went his way as farm-horse, saddle-horse,
carriage-horse: always endearing himself to every
one associated with him. It was his perfect training and
his willingness to obey that was ever the secret of success
of Justin Morgan.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p>By this time Montpelier was growing so prosperous,
being made the capital in 1808, that people began to
think more of pleasure parties, and bees of all sorts were
held. History gives the credit to Mistress Debbie
Daphne Davis for inventing pumpkin pies, without a
goodly supply of which no company was considered complete.

Even Goss had his share of these, for every one
paid him attentions when he waited outside a house for
his rider. He found the pies very palatable, for at the
kitchen windows of his women friends he had learned
to appreciate many concoctions not usually known to
horses.</p>

<p>Sometimes a lady rode him to meeting in St. Johnsbury.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a>
The meeting house was little larger than his
stall, and from where he waited he could hear the
preacher shouting forth healthy doctrine in liberal measure
with a strong flavor of brimstone. After this the
congregation would rise, noisily, as with relief, and sing
a hymn at the tops of their voices. Sometimes they
sang “Mear,” which ever reminded Morgan of the Randolph
singing-teacher who had been his good friend, and
whose name he once bore.</p>

<p>Vermonters were real Christians in those days and
regulations regarding the keeping of the Holy Sabbath
were enforced by tithing-men who walked among the
people during Meeting to see that they behaved themselves
in a seemly manner. If any one was caught asleep
or inattentive, and a Christian whack over the head with
a hymn-book did not waken him to a fitting sense of his
responsibilities, a committee of Selectmen “waited” upon
him the next day with results entirely satisfactory.</p>

<p>Such visits, however, were uncommon. The pioneers
of Vermont were a law-abiding people, honest, thrifty,
religious and possessing all the virtues that go to make
up a strong, fine race.</p>

<p>That same year, 1808, Goss found himself in Burlington

for a time, and had an adventure known in the history
of Vermont, although his name has never before
been recorded in connection with it.</p>

<p>One evening he went, under the saddle of a revenue
officer, bent on a secret mission, to the mouth of the
Winooski.</p>

<p>Chill and darkness settled on the forest, stars came
out and they tarried at the farm of Ira Allen, at Rocky
Point, until the great yellow moon swam into sight and
other officers joined them.</p>

<p>Leaves rustled softly as they started out through the
woods, an owl hooted solemnly, and from somewhere far
off a whippoorwill called.</p>

<p>A short ride brought them to rugged rocks and rude
cliffs overhanging the river, in the then almost untouched
forest, where Goss was left behind a sheltering boulder.</p>

<p>In a few moments he distinctly saw a boat floating
on the quiet bosom of the water. The far-flung sound of
men’s voices came to him borne on the slight wind that
sighed in the treetops. It was an inexpressibly lonely
spot, and Goss shuddered once with a feeling of impending
tragedy.</p>

<p>Having heard much talk of the Smuggler—&#8203;“Black
Snake”—&#8203;for which the Government had been watching
so long—&#8203;with rum, brandy, and wines on board—&#8203;it was
not hard for him to guess why the officers were here.</p>

<p>As the vessel hove to, shadowy figures dropped from
her side and began unloading kegs and indistinguishable
objects. For a time deathly stillness reigned. Ever
responsive to influences, Goss breathed softly, and did
not sneeze. The officers stepped as lightly as cats, bracing
themselves.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was the crackle of a musket from the
bank, followed by others, then the boat answered, shot
for shot. The woods blazed—&#8203;the echoes woke. Bullets

whistled through the trees above the horse, but he
neither flinched nor whinneyed as the scattered leaves
fell about him. After a while, quivering with subdued
excitement, he strained his neck forward with dilating
nostrils—&#8203;he hoped it was a battle!</p>

<p>And it was—&#8203;in a small way.</p>

<p>A man, poised on the deck of the “Black Snake,”
swayed and pitched head-first into the river and sank
beneath the dark water. There were oaths and cries,
then the “Black Snake” gathered sail and sped before
the rising wind down the river and out of sight, followed
by a volley of musketry.</p>

<p>This was but one of the many episodes of that border
State, Vermont, which gave her an atmosphere of adventure
and filled her young men with courage and her
women with that quality of coolness which faces life
and its cares unflinchingly.</p>

<p>A little later Goss saw several men advancing, tired,
silent and grim. They were mountain men and stern,
they had not much to say, but they bore between them
the lifeless body of the officer who had so lately been
the horse’s pleasant rider.</p>

<p>Goss shivered as they placed their burden across his
back.</p>

<p>As they set out wearily toward Burlington between
crag and tree the dawn showed, coming over the mountain,
spreading long shafts of crimson on the placid lake.
Tahawas, towering above the former domains of the
Iroquois Indians, reared his lofty head dimly in the distance
through the dispersing mists.</p>

<p>Slowly they went through the forest over thick pine
needles which deadened their steps, through vague shadowy
dells where ferns grew rank and cool streams
trickled; on through the pathless woods until finally they
reached a farm-clearing, in the centre of which, set in a

frame of apples trees, stood a long, low house. Reverently
the men lifted the burden from the horse’s back,
and, with lowered heads and measured tread, they bore
it into the house.</p>

<p>Goss waited patiently. He heard a robin singing in an
apple tree among the rustling leaves. He watched a
hairy woodpecker run up the side of a tree, using his
bill as a pick-axe and scaling off bits of bark sideways
as he ran, disturbing a squirrel who sprang nimbly from
limb to limb. A meadow-lark dipped across the sky over
level fields of delicious beans, maize and squashes; a
partridge called from the distance and fleecy clouds
floated across the now full-risen sun casting long shadows
on the lake, like the spirit of Hiawatha’s white canoe—&#8203;to
the southward grim Regiohne, gloomy sentinel of
rock, kept guard. Around all the fine frame of mountains
ranged.</p>

<p>In the golden morning sunshine Nature glowed with
happiness. Then all at once a low sound came to Goss’s
pricking ears, the sound of a woman weeping, and a
shadow fell across the doorway, as of an angel’s wing.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>The Goss horse played his part, too, in many fine affairs.
The following year at the inauguration of the
Preacher-Governor, Jonas Galusha, he had the honor of
carrying the newly-elected Chief Magistrate in the grand
parade. Crowds shouted and cheered as they passed,
drums were beaten and guns fired. Goss was almost
as much noticed as the Governor himself!</p>

<p>The Executive spoke in the town hall, outside which
the horse waited. Goss could hear the applause now and
then, and when the speech was finished a wag cried out:</p>

<p>“Now let’s sing ‘Mear’!”</p>

<p>Every one knew that “Mear” was the Governor’s favorite

hymn, but instead of singing, as Goss hoped they
would, an outburst of laughter greeted the suggestion,
and the crowd poured noisily out into the street once
more.</p>

<p>Goss had a good time that day prancing to the music
and showing off. His enjoyment of such gay doings always
made him popular with the men, yet so gentle
was he that women constantly borrowed him to ride to
meetings, quiltings, bees, or funerals.</p>

<p>At Burlington in this same year, 1809, the launching
of the steamboat “Vermont” (of which they had talked
so long) took place. The “Vermont” had been built
<em>second</em> to the “Clermont” (launched on the Hudson,
about two years before), but an unavoidable delay made
her the <em>fifth</em> steamboat to be launched.</p>

<p>At great expense this passenger steamer had been built
and was to run from White Hall to St. Johns in twenty-four
hours! It was almost too much to ask the people
to believe, said the newspapers! One and all they predicted
failure. Steamboats in those days occupied much
the same place in the estimation of the people as airships
did a hundred years later. Many called it a foolish
waste of money, and dangerous withal, but John Winans,
who made the boat, was confident it would mark an
epoch in history.</p>

<p>Larger and finer than the “Clermont,” the success of
the “Vermont” on Lake Champlain does not concern our
hero.</p>

<p>The streets were crowded with passengers from the
mail coaches; the Foote House was taxed to capacity;
four-, six- and eight-horse teams, with now and then a
Canadian spike-team, blocked the thoroughfares.</p>

<p>Into this atmosphere of excitement and interest David
and Goss cantered early that morning, and put up at the
house of Mr. Loomis. This historic house had sheltered

His Royal Highness, Edward, Duke of Kent, who, in
the year 1793, was travelling with his suite in sleighs
from Boston to Canada. It was built of logs hewn out
with a broad-axe and made a most warm and fitting
place for so great a personage to tarry in, not less comfortable
did our two more humble friends find it sixteen
years later.</p>

<p>Nothing eventful occurred after the launching of the
boat except that Goss met a horse from Maryland, who
gave him news of Mistress Lloyd, now married to an
army officer, known as the dashing Lieutenant Tom Dulaney.</p>

<p>The Southern horse told him also of the lately opened
Baltimore course and of the great race there between
Mr. Ogle’s Oscar and First Consul, and how Oscar ran
the second heat in the extraordinary time of 7:40, a
speed that had never been exceeded for the same distance,
and which seemed almost a miracle!</p>

<h3>IN THE FLOOD OF 1811.</h3>


<p>In 1811 Samuel Stone bought the little horse and
changed his name back to Morgan. Once more he
went to live in Randolph, which had been the scene of
his early triumphs.</p>

<p>There had been many changes in the town, and nearly
all his old friends had moved away or outgrown their
interest in tests of strength and speed. Only one of
them was left, James Kelsey, and he, being fond of
horses, often rode Morgan from place to place for Stone.</p>

<p>Kelsey was called the village “cut-up,” though he was
no longer a boy, but he had a kind heart and was the
friend of every one. Sometimes he rode the Morgan
alongside the stage-coaches and thrilled the passengers
with stories of pioneer times; of bears, and Indians.</p>

<p>One day, as they were nearing Tunbridge, Kelsey told
them of the burning of that place by three hundred Indians,
who swept down from the north under the command
of a British soldier, Lieutenant Horton.</p>

<p>This reference to the British reminded Morgan of his
old enemy, the Tory boy, whose dog had killed Black
Baby. The boy must now have reached man’s estate,
and Morgan wondered if he would recognize him if he
saw him, and if Allah was planning an opportunity for
him to give his promised kick. In all these years he had
never forgotten his vow.</p>

<p>Kelsey was a very skillful rider, and could do wonderful
things from a horse’s back, which Morgan enjoyed,

for it showed off his smooth and easy gaits. Sometimes,
after slipping off his heavy boots and tying them to his
stirrup, he would spring to his feet on the horse’s back,
and stand balancing himself while Morgan glided evenly
along under him; or, riding hard, he would stoop and
pick up a stone or stick; or, if there chanced to be a
pretty flower beside the road, he would set the horse
running and lean swiftly down, pluck the flower, and
wait for the coach to catch up, that he might hand it to
some lady passenger, with a bow and sweep of his hat.</p>

<p>One of his anecdotes, which always brought a laugh
from the passengers—&#8203;especially if they were from New
York—&#8203;was how the tract of land, now known as Vermont,
was granted to Dominie Dillius, of Albany, in
1696, for the “annuall rente of one racoon skinne.”</p>

<p>“The New York legislature,” Kelsey always finished,
“later called this ‘rente’ <em>excessive</em>!”</p>

<p>During that spring there came a scourge of locusts.
They ate up the trees and all green things. Wise old
women declared them a sign of coming disaster—&#8203;disaster
enough they were of themselves! With their strident
cries they drowned the prayers of the Righteous
who sat in meeting praying to be delivered from them
and their consequences.</p>

<p>One day at noon a darkness fell over everything;
cocks crew; pigs squealed; cows came home, lowing;
dogs howled, dismally; and cats mewed, distressingly.</p>

<p>Morgan, sensitive to all influences, shivered and
moaned, softly.</p>

<p>One of the most fearsome calamities in the history of
Vermont was, indeed, about to descend.</p>

<p>Masses of clouds rose and blotted out the sun; the
storm came closer; thunder crashed; the wind howled;
rain began to fall.</p>

<p>Day after day lightning flashed, thunder jarred the

earth, and the rain fell unceasingly. There seemed no
end to it!</p>

<p>Creek and river beds lost all identity; mountains were
obscured in the downpour. In lowlands, beaver meadows
and swampy places the water rose, and kept rising.
Mountain streams became torrents, creeks became rivers.</p>

<p>It was a deluge!</p>

<p>Birds, drenched through their feathers, starved and
fell to the earth, chilled to death; insects were washed
out of the air; late-hatched broods of wild ducks were
drowned and the eggs of wild-fowl floated on the surface
of the waters.</p>

<p>Weasels, stoats and such creatures as could swim
reached higher ground and for a short time saved their
lives. Cattle, which had sought slightly dryer quarters
on hillocks, were drowned as they called aloud, piteously,
for help. Field-mice, rabbits and moles were suffocated
in the rain-sodden earth. Foxes climbed into bushes to
await the going down of the waters and were drowned,
or starved to death, waiting.</p>

<p>This was the year men praised the Lord for directing
them to build their towns on hills, for they were
thus above the valley floods that poured towards the
Connecticut or the lake. But all about their homes the
pine-needles and underbrush held the water like a
sponge.</p>

<p>On one of the very worst nights of the “flood” Samuel
Stone set out to help a neighbor rescue his cattle.</p>

<p>Stone apologized to Morgan for taking him out on
such a night, with thunder and lightning so terrible.</p>

<p>“’Tis hard to go out in such weather, Pony, but we
must help our neighbors in their troubles, else when we
are in straits they will not come to us!”</p>

<p>The dense blackness and silence that followed the rapid
flashes of orange lightning and roaring thunder—&#8203;and

his natural terror of storms—&#8203;confused Morgan’s sight
and hearing.</p>

<p>Fortunately, however, he had never had rheumatism,
nor stiffness of any kind, and his reluctance to leave his
leaky stable was counteracted by his desire to do his
duty bravely.</p>

<p>Trusting blindly in his master’s judgment, he cantered
off.</p>

<p>The wind blew and whistled like evil spirits, the
swaying trees bent almost to the ground, but at last they
reached the neighbor’s house and succeeded in saving his
terrified cattle, though with great difficulty. Afterwards
the neighbor besought them to pass the night, but Stone
refused, saying that, “by morning the bridges would all
be gone and they must be getting home-along before
that happened!”</p>

<p>Hurriedly partaking of a hot supper in the leaking
kitchen, near a sputtering fire, and after giving Morgan
a good, warm mash, Stone mounted and rode away into
the storm and night.</p>

<p>Darkness fell about them like a blanket; there was
nothing for the rider to do but leave it to his horse’s instinct
and sense of direction to take him home.</p>

<p>Not once did Justin Morgan hesitate.</p>

<p>Very soon, by the roar of water the horse knew they
were near Beaver Creek, a torrent, rising high in the
mountains, and gathering strength as it raced and tore
to the valley through narrow gorges, was now a raging
cataract. In crossing this stream earlier, Morgan had
perceived that the bridge could not last much longer;
he had felt the timbers tremble under his tread.</p>

<p>Now, several hours later, he could hear the current,
more angry than before, whirling its mass of foam and
<i lang="fr">débris</i> against the banks. As they reached the place
where the bridge ought to have been not a ray of starlight

showed Stone it was no longer there. But involuntarily,
he refrained from guiding or suggesting to
the horse any course of action. The reins lay loose even
when Morgan paused at the brink of the torrent.</p>

<p>Leaning forward, Stone patted the horse’s neck gently,
and said in a soothing voice:</p>

<p>“Steady, Boy, steady!”</p>

<p>Morgan responded.</p>

<p>He could see with his keen eyes, the white, turbid
water, below the very place where the bridge had been—&#8203;one
stringer alone of the structure remained, and this
was scarce above the violent current! The rushing,
churning water swirled against the banks impetuously.</p>

<p>Cautiously, the horse tried the wide beam with one
foot. Feeling it secure, he tried another; in the inky
darkness, he pushed his feet along gently, lest he step
on an upstanding nail.</p>

<p>Steadily, firmly, without wavering, without—&#8203;above all—&#8203;interference
from his rider, he went on over the spinning
foam on his narrow foot-bridge.</p>

<p>At last he put his foot on solid ground and, with a
slight, throaty sound of relief, he cantered briskly off
toward home.</p>

<p>As they neared the house he whinneyed, as was his
custom, and Mistress Stone threw open the door and
stood silhouetted against the radiance from within. The
glow of firelight penetrated the darkness, and from a
guttering candle, held high above her head, a tiny beam
of welcome went out to her good man.</p>

<p>“Oh, Samuel,” she cried, right joyfully, “’tis a great
comfort to hear your voice again! By what road came
you back?”</p>

<p>“By Beaver Creek Road, wife,” he made answer.</p>

<p>“But, look you, the bridge is gone—&#8203;how crossed you
the creek?”
</p>

<p>“By the bridge, all the same—&#8203;’twas not gone five minutes
ago.”</p>

<p>“But, indeed, ’tis washed away a long time since,” his
wife cried, in amazement, “for James Kelsey came by
these two hours agone and told me he had but just
crossed in time. Scarce had he landed on this side when
there was a great crashing and grinding of timbers and
the whole thing was swept away before his very eyes!
He saw by a flash of lightning—&#8203;all went but one stringer
which was wedged against the rocks at either end!”</p>

<p>And, marvelling together, they fed the “pony” as befitted
a hero, though Morgan looked upon it as but an
incident in the day’s work and went about his delicious
supper with placid forgetfulness of all else.

<h3>UNDER CAPTAIN DULANEY.</h3>


<p>Then one day the sun rose clear and bright, the waters
sank and the mountains showed clean-cut against the
fleckless sky—&#8203;but no bees buzzed, no sweet odors filled
the air, no wild flowers carpeted the woods, no butterflies
fluttered, no birds sang.</p>

<p>Vermont tasted that year the bitter cup of desolation.</p>

<p>A dire scourge of spotted fever, or “plague,” the doctors
called it, broke out, severest in Montpelier. Consternation
was great among the Sabbath-abiding folk
who claimed solemnly that the affliction was due to the
worldly ways and “flunk and flummux” of the “foreigners”
who came from other states to pass the summer in
the Green Mountains. Even the women of Vermont,
themselves, had taken to wearing laces, ribbands, frills
and furbelows—&#8203;most unbecoming in God-fearing females!</p>

<p>Stagnant water stood in pools, here and there, houses
were damp, there were no crops, and all food was mouldy
and unwholesome, for lack of sunshine.</p>

<p>In Montpelier men went from house to house, carrying
long bathing vessels, and such of the women as had not
yet been attacked with the “plague” bathed the stricken
ones in an infusion of hemlock boughs. Doctors bled
them and dosed them with teas more or less harmful
made of ginseng, pleurisy-root and marshmallow. Fresh
air, sunshine and pure water with proper nourishment

would have been better, but in those days bleeding and
herb-teas were the two panaceas for all ills.</p>

<p>In Williston, Dame Susannah Wells, who had reached
the ripe age of one hundred and four years and seen her
descendants die year after year of old age—&#8203;without
warning fell ill with the plague and died. Had it not
been for this her acquaintances had long since come to
the conclusion she would have lived forever. Children
and babies were mowed down with equal impartiality by
the Reaper; men and women succumbed; but Morgan’s
hardihood saved him from any ill effects of the long, wet
season.</p>

<p>Events in his life, following 1811, were not of great
importance and may be passed over until Stone put him
up for sale in Burlington, at the stable of the Rev. Daniel
Clark Sanders, President of the fine College on the hill.
There he stayed for a long time, as he was growing old,
they said, and no one wanted to buy him. President Sanders
was quite willing, for he had the use and care of
him all that while. Now and then Stone came to the
stable with a prospective buyer, but a trade was never
consummated.</p>

<p>As a convenient dooryard Ira Allen had given a space
of fifty acres around the College, called The Green. It
was still full of stumps and piles of brush, but made a
delightful place for the cows and horses of the town to
graze, and here Morgan had many agreeable experiences.</p>

<p>The merry students, passing by, gave him friendly
greeting always and a dainty of some kind from their
lunches; he learned to know the whistle of many and
whinneyed to them as they ran toward him.</p>

<p>Often, as he stood nibbling grass he saw a strange
looking youth limp across the Green with never a nod or
greeting for him or any one else. Absorbed, stern of

expression, and morose, this lad was destined to rise to
prominence, the like of which could not be foreseen in
one without influence, the son of a poor, hard working
widow. This lame boy was none other than young
Thaddeus Stevens, who, by industry and perseverance,
gained his book-learning in Burlington and later graduated
at Dartmouth College.</p>

<p>Burlington was now a very different place from the
logging camp Morgan first remembered. The old
wharf, made of a few logs fastened together, at the foot
of King’s Street, had given way to a fine new one;
houses had taken the place of camps and were scattered
as far as the Winooski.</p>

<p>The College on the Hill, commanding the lake, gave
distinction to the town, seeming to crown it with a cap
of learning; Ira Allen’s iron foundries, mills and forges
gave work to many, and linen, woolen and cotton mills
had been built; an immense quantity of liquor was distilled.
It was a busy and prosperous town, having
grown greatly in importance since Ira Allen launched
his first schooner, “Liberty,” a long while before.</p>

<p>One day Stone brought to the stable an army officer.
The military hat was set well upon the handsome head
of the stranger, a cloak was flung with careless grace
about his shoulder; spurs shone on his heels and a sword
clanked, musically, at his side.</p>

<p>Intuitively, Morgan liked this man. It was easy to see
he was a fine, brave American soldier, with a cool and
level head. His uniform was grand and inspiring to the
horse, who still looked upon soldiers and the idea of war
with quivering anticipation.</p>

<p>“So this is the horse, eh?” the officer asked Stone, and
Morgan knew by his soft tone and speech that he came
from the same state as Mistress Lloyd—&#8203;there was no
mistaking a Marylander! As the stranger caught the

halter his touch was so firm and friendly the horse knew
instantly that here was his <em>master</em>. He arched his crest,
pawed the ground prettily, and thrust his large, sensitive
nostrils forward.</p>

<p>Stone led him out into the bright sunshine; the officer
examined him thoroughly—&#8203;an operation Morgan had
long since grown accustomed to, as he had changed
owners so often.</p>

<p>A flame of friendship sprang up between the two.</p>

<p>“I can scarce credit his age to be twenty-two!” said
the stranger. “He has such suppleness of joint, he
moves with the action of a five-year-old!”</p>

<p>Stone was pleased and proud of his horse; he said:</p>

<p>“Those are his characteristics, Captain Dulaney!”</p>

<p>Dulaney? Morgan’s memory awoke, vaguely.</p>

<p>“And from what stock, did you say?” the officer enquired.</p>

<p>Stone let him know all that was said concerning Morgan’s
parentage. Then he continued:</p>

<p>“He has worked hard at the plow, most of his life, and
he is not known in horse-books, but we Vermonters don’t
take much interest in pedigrees. We say, ‘pretty is as
pretty does’ and present merit is what we go by, Captain—&#8203;not
what his <em>ancestors</em> did!”</p>

<p>The Maryland gentleman laughed, seeing the point.</p>

<p>“Blood speaks for itself, right here,” Captain Dulaney
said. “I will wager my new sword that this horse has
thoroughbred blood! So you see your argument about
pedigree does not hold!”</p>

<p>Morgan waved his tail slightly, in acknowledgment.</p>

<p>“I like the animal,” added the Captain, in his quiet,
pleasant way. “I would mount him, sir.”</p>

<p>In ten minutes Morgan was accoutred in the military
trappings and saddle of an officer of the United States
Army. It was with a thrill that he felt the Captain

throw his fine-dressed leg across his back and slip his
cavalry-booted feet into the stirrups—&#8203;all the while holding
the reins in his masterful hand. A mutual confidence
was awakened between the two that was to last
always.</p>

<p>Morgan, feeling as young as he did ten years before,
cantered smoothly off, side-stepping just enough to give
his rider something to do.</p>

<p>Down the hill they went, the horse as sure-footed as
a goat, feeling that he had never carried so dashing and
gallant a rider nor so congenial a spirit, and right glad
was he to respond to every gentle pressure of the bit
or motion of the rein.</p>

<p>At the turn of the trail they came to a stone fence. At
his rider’s suggestion Morgan paused slightly, pulled
himself together, rose in the air and cleared it. Over a
rushing little stream he went in the same confident, bird-like
way, galloping easily off as he touched the ground
on the other side.</p>

<p>The blue sky was reflected in the lake, and the mountains
in New York pierced it, in reality, or reflection,
with peaks of green and brown. The air was still and
pure and the cool scent of the pines was strong in their
nostrils. The haze of the morning had given place to a
crystal clearness and Juniper Island was like a spot of
precious jade set in a field of turquoise.</p>

<p>They were on the way to the Falls at a smart gallop
now, and what his rider intimated to the horse along
the bridle-rein gave him courage and love combined with
perfect understanding. At a convenient spot they
stopped, and Captain Dulaney spoke aloud.</p>

<p>“Ah, my fine fellow!” Morgan flicked his tail in reply,
and tossed his mane slightly—&#8203;with an up and down motion
once or twice of his crest as was his habit when
spoken to, directly—&#8203;“Ah, my fine fellow, this air makes

one breathe deeply. There’s no climate like it. No
wonder these Vermonters are giants morally and physically.
No wonder the Green Mountain Boys could take
Ticonderoga! A handful of men bred in this air are
worth all the city-bred officers in the British Army.
And forsooth, they proved it! Ha! Ha! If it comes
to an attack by water from Canada on the lake, here, we
have a superabundance of trained officers and men.”</p>

<p>He dismounted and spread a map on the ground,
weighting the corners with pink and red fragments of
stones picked up at random. Had he known it, these
were pieces of marble, later to make that locality famous,
when the quarries were discovered.</p>

<p>In silence he studied the map, the bridle rein hanging
across his arm. Then he folded it, sprang suddenly into
the saddle and continued his thinking aloud as they
started off:</p>

<p>“Now if we could be sure of the Vermonters in this
war, but they seem to think fighting foolish—&#8203;and in this
they may be right, eh, Morgan? New England is in a
ferment, but we’ve got to stick by the President and
fight it out. Although they call it ‘Mr. Madison’s War,’
that poor man is the most unwilling participant in it!
The thing is to find which way the cat will jump here;
that’s my business. These secret emissaries from England
and Canada may be right here now, rousing the
Vermonters to join Canada. But may be the sight of
a good old Continental uniform—&#8203;God bless it!—&#8203;may
bring them our way!”</p>

<p>The lake glinted blue in the sunshine, the birds twittered
in the forest, as they passed on slowly.</p>

<p>Suddenly Captain Dulaney addressed the horse gaily:</p>

<p>“Look at that view, Morgan. Shall we let a king
wrest it from us? No, I swear it! This air is like
wine. Who would live in towns, say I, with houses

crowding, one upon the other, peeping over each other’s
heads to see the narrow streets that lie between? Not
I, for one. Give me trees and sky, rivers and fields, and
the green country down in Maryland, ‘Where the Great
Lloyd sets his Hall.’”</p>

<p>Morgan started. He turned his straight, intelligent
face full round and looked at his rider. A smile, quick
and magnetic, met his dark, prominent eye. Then a light
flooded his horse mind. No wonder he loved this officer!
Had he not won him for Mistress Lloyd so long ago?
He remembered all now. From the tip of his tail to his
fine, sharp ears he quivered with happiness. Maybe after
a life-time of waiting he would see her again!</p>

<p>Overhead the sky was cloudless, but suddenly across
its face came sweeping into view, over-shadowing the
woods for a moment, a dense flock of wild pigeons. The
Captain leaned forward and patted Morgan’s neck.</p>

<p>“Just pigeons, old man! Is that why you shivered?
Or is there something you want to say?”</p>

<p>But Morgan could not answer in words, he could only
hope and serve. He did wish, however, that Captain
Dulaney would not call him “old”! He had years of
usefulness before him yet!</p>

<p>“I wish my sweet wife were here now to enjoy this
view with us!”</p>

<p>Morgan replied with a toss of his head.</p>

<p>“But she is coming!”</p>

<p>Morgan whinneyed, softly, and trembled all over.</p>

<p>“God bless her!” went on the Captain, his blue eyes
deepening to a light, wholly tender, “She would scarce
consent to my coming up here without her. She argued
with me, the witch, that Mistress Washington had passed
the winter at Valley Forge, and she did not love her
General any more than my wife loved her Captain! It
was a clinching argument, Morgan, my friend, and I had

to promise that she should come when all was ready—&#8203;and
there she is waiting in Boston until I send for her.”</p>

<p>Morgan tossed his head, and his tail waved slightly.</p>

<p>“She shall ride you, little horse, for, by my sword,
there never was a more delightful, under the saddle.
My mind is made up, I shall buy you, old as you are!”</p>

<p>There it was again—&#8203;“As old as you are.” Age! what
has age to do with it if the heart and spirit are young?</p>

<p>“As for these Vermonters,” the Captain continued,
thinking aloud, and riding on, “they are brave, fine men
and they will stand by Ethan Allen’s ideals; if war
comes they will be with us. I’ve felt the pulse of Vermont
from North to South, and I believe in them in
spite of their reserve and non-committal attitude.”</p>

<p>They galloped on over rocky, new-cleared spaces,
across streams and fences, and pushed their way slowly
through underbrush. When they stopped, Dulaney
pulled Morgan’s lean head round and caught his bright,
pleasant eye. The Captain winked at him with a
chuckle.</p>

<p>“We’ll win this war <span class="lock">yet——”</span></p>

<p>So there was to be a war! Morgan’s pupils dilated,
his nostrils spread.</p>

<p>“Yes, we’ll win this war, as we did the other,” and
the officer nodded his head with conviction. “I was but
a lad of ten, Morgan, when we heard of Cornwallis’ surrender,
in 1781. ’Twas a crisp autumn day and I well
recall the shouting and hurrahing, the patriotic acclamations
and glowing ardor of the Americans.</p>

<p>“To-day we have no Washington, no Hamilton, no
La Fayette. We can but wait and see. But to me it
seems a foregone conclusion. We have the larger ships,
the heavier ordnance, and we are superior in seamanship
and gunnery. Our vessels are few, but equipped

thoroughly. Right will prevail—&#8203;and we are right,
aren’t we, Morgan?”</p>

<p>Having finished his somewhat whimsical remarks, he
wheeled his horse once more, and galloped toward Rocky
Point where he stopped long—&#8203;taking further observations
of lake and country, turning in his saddle and gazing
with thoughtful brow in every direction, scanning
the horizon line, the lake, the streams, the roads.</p>

<p>Before the day was done they had skirted the rugged
coast and crossed the sand-bar to La Grande Isle. So
great was the number of salmon in those days that, as
Morgan waded knee-deep in the water among them, they
splashed away from his feet, as if in play.</p>

<p>Squirrels ran over the ground on the island and chattered
down at them from the boughs. Clear and deep
the blue lake lay, the woods coming to the very edge
where poplars trembled in the clear light and tall,
straight white-pines towered like sentinels.</p>

<p>From Island Point they could see Plattsburg Harbor,
and here Captain Dulaney again sat for a long time
buried in thought, looking across the wild, dark forest
and lake.</p>

<p>At dusk they bent their faces homeward, both horse
and rider absorbed in his own meditations until they
reached College Hill.</p>

<p>Early next morning Samuel Stone came to bid the
Morgan good-bye, telling him he had been bought by
Captain Dulaney, and that he “was a very lucky horse!”
Morgan knew this far better than Stone—&#8203;wasn’t Mistress
Dulaney coming, and would he not have the happiness
of cantering under her saddle once more?</p>

<p>But she did not come at once. During the fall and
winter of 1812 and 1813, the United States troops arrived
and were settled in the College buildings, now
called United States Barracks for the winter.
</p>

<p>Captain Dulaney rode Morgan daily and taught him
to be a true cavalry horse and to obey bugle calls. So
obedient did he become and so conscientious was he,
that, one day when he was attached to a “shay” at the
foot of the hill, he heard the bugle sound “Charge.”
He obeyed instantly on the impulse, snapping his hitch
rein sharply. Up the hill he “charged” at full speed, the
shay rattling on behind! ’Twas not his fault that it
was not shaken into bits! From a colt it had been his
instinct to obey without question, and certainly, at last,
in the service of his country he did not hesitate!</p>

<p>Soldiers, off duty, lounging idly in the shade, roused
themselves with a great roar of laughter as the old horse
charged toward them. An orderly sprang forward and
caught the bit. Not a strap, not a tug was broken!
Every one cheered heartily, for “Old Justin Morgan”
had come to be a character at the post and was loved
by all, men as well as officers.</p>

<p>Time passed and still Mistress Dulaney did not come,
though every day Morgan looked for the one great, human
love of his life. He wondered if she remembered
him—&#8203;if she recalled the part he had played in freeing
her from the Coxcomb, and winning her the man she
loved.</p>

<p>In the spring of 1813, when the ice broke up, a fleet
was fitted out. Oak timbers, cut on the Winooski, were
sawed at the mills, nails and bolts were fashioned out of
hot iron at the forges where even the bellows breathed
patriotism. Masts and spars were tapered and sails
made. Liberty poles were set up on eminences—&#8203;the
higher the pole the stronger the patriotism. Everything
indicated war.</p>

<p>Commodore Macdonough took command of the lake
and naval stores and ammunition arrived from the
South. All seemed waiting for the call to arms when

an epidemic of lung-fever broke out among the troops
stationed at the barracks.</p>

<p>Captain Dulaney was stricken, and lay ill unto death
at his quarters. Morgan missed him and pined for his
company.</p>

<p>A letter was dispatched to Mistress Dulaney, but the
distance to Boston was so great that a man might die
before the stage went and returned to Burlington. At
last when the coach rattled up, with a great noise and
hurly-burly, to the officer’s quarters and stopped, all
knew that Mistress Dulaney was inside, and it chanced
that Morgan stood hitched near-by. The steps were
quickly let down and right quickly did she descend.</p>

<p>Morgan recognized her at once; he whinneyed a note
of welcome, but she neither saw nor heard him; she was
in such stress of anxiety.</p>

<p>She was all his memory held her: not so young, but
more sweet, more beautiful and a light as of a halo surrounded
her face as they told her the Captain was better.
Morgan saw all before she put her little foot to
the ground.</p>

<p>But as she hurried into the house the horse felt old,
a sudden darkness fell upon the world, as if a cloud had
obscured the sun.</p>

<p>She had not even <em>seen</em> him!</p>

<p>He hung his head and tears filled his dear, longing
eyes. After all these years of waiting and loving—&#8203;and
she had not even seen him!

<h3>MORGAN MEETS HIS LADY AGAIN.</h3>


<p>But Captain Dulaney did not die of the “lung
fever,” as so many did. He was made for a nobler end
and had work yet to do.</p>

<p>The mutterings of war came ever nearer and nearer
to Lake Champlain and crowded out all other thoughts
and interests.</p>

<p>Morgan waited two weeks for a sight of his Lady.
Nobody came to tell him the news, so he could only hope
the Captain would recover and need to go for an airing
after a while.</p>

<p>One day the orderly, a mannerly youth whom horses
liked, groomed him so carefully that the old horse
guessed the airing he had looked forward to was about
to take place.</p>

<p>He was scarcely able to control his impatience as he
stood at the step waiting. He was sure she would see
him this time, and he trembled with longing, and the
hope that she had not forgotten him.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>She came down the steps slowly, the Captain, a little
weak still, leaning on her arm, yet not entirely for support—&#8203;a
little for the joy of laying his thin, white hand
on her strong, steady one.</p>

<p>At last, as her husband spoke, she raised her eyes.</p>

<p>“This is the horse I’ve written you so much about,
my Hollyhock!”</p>

<p>She knew him at once!
</p>

<p>“Why, my dear! ’Tis the very horse that won you
for me!” she cried, joyfully; she might forget a person—&#8203;his
lady—&#8203;but never a horse. “Why did you not tell me
so before? I have asked so often about him, and
’twould have brought me to Vermont before this!”</p>

<p>The Captain smiled.</p>

<p>“I shall be jealous of my charger,” he said, tenderly.</p>

<p>Morgan rubbed his muzzle on Mistress Dulaney’s
sleeve and in the laces at her neck, thinking her soft
Southern voice the sweetest he had ever heard, even
more sweet than when she was a maid.</p>

<p>“Ah, dear husband, but for this horse I should be the
most unhappy of women instead of the happiest! ’Twas
he who won that race so many years ago and gave you
to me. I have ever wanted to call him my own!”</p>

<p>“Then you may call him so now, sweet Wife. From
to-day Morgan is yours.”</p>

<p>At last, at last! Oh, the years of waiting and longing.
Oh, the weary hopelessness of some of them at the
plow-among men who could not understand and did
not try. At last! He arched his crest and pawed the
earth with joy.</p>

<p>“I shall lend him to you sometimes.” She looked at
her lord, archly lifting her sweet face to his as they
stood very close together. At a soft, sweet sound Morgan
showed more spirit.</p>

<p>“‘He paweth in the valley and rejoiceth in his
strength; he goeth forth to meet the armed men,’”
Mistress Dulaney quoted, mockingly, her hand resting
on the horse’s face, her cheek against his.</p>

<p>Presently the Captain mounted, lighter by several
pounds than was his wont, and Morgan glided off.</p>

<p>“Take good care of him, Little Horse,” were her parting
words.</p>

<hr class="tb">


<p>Early that summer, when the feeling of victory was
running high, the American Sloop of War, “Growler,”
was captured by the British gun-boats on the Upper
Lake. The Americans equipped a small fleet and drove
the enemy back into Canada.</p>

<p>The State Militia, stationed at Plattsburg, was ordered
home in November, by Governor Chittenden, but most
of the officers remained. The privates—&#8203;from the first,
unwilling to enlist—&#8203;were glad enough to return to their
families who needed them sorely. They would much
rather chop and dig at home, they said, having found
nothing to do in Plattsburg but repair the barracks.</p>

<p>Every day Captain or Mistress Dulaney rode Morgan
out for exercise, and he enjoyed the easy, pleasant life
with its military atmosphere. His lady visited him
every morning early and gave him many delicious morsels
of food, and the old horse seemed to grow younger
day by day. She talked to him of all sorts of interesting
things in tones, so wonderfully sweet, the birds in the
Green Mountains would have died of envy, could they
have heard them.</p>

<p>Sometimes errands with Captain Dulaney were of
great secrecy and importance. One night quite late they
went away toward the North and passed the night at a
barn, watching a suspicious locality. As they were
about to start homeward, the Captain searched carefully
and found a furled flag, lying on a beam. He took it
down and unrolled it, looking for secret signs, but the
flag was right enough. It was made of the finest linen,
home-spun, and was fifteen feet long by four wide. In
its centre was an eagle perched on a rock, bearing in its
talons a shield with thirteen stripes and some arrows.
In his beak was a pine sprig, and over the eagle was
painted “Independence Forever.” The word “Swanton”
was painted on it in another hand.
</p>

<p>As Captain Dulaney noticed the last word he said to
himself, with relief:</p>

<p>“’Tis well! We’ve nothing to fear. Lieutenant Van
Sicklen was right. The people in this locality are patriots.
He will return this way, perhaps, so I shall put
the flag back with my private mark.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>He made a certain distinguishing mark and laid the
flag back on the sill.</p>

<p>A strange event occurred on their way home through
the darkness.</p>

<p>Suddenly there was a hissing, as of red hot iron thrust
into water, a familiar sound to Morgan who had lived
so long near a forge, and then there came a violent explosion.
The earth fairly shook, and the horse felt his
rider start in the saddle. He himself was so taken by
surprise that he stopped so sharply his hoofs plowed
great furrows in the ground.</p>

<p>Then Captain Dulaney spoke, and the sound of his
steady voice quieted him.</p>

<p>“’Tis but a mass of iron fallen from space, old fellow—&#8203;a
meteor, they call it—&#8203;a rare and interesting sight
if one happens to be far enough away! Any nearer for
us might have made Mistress Dulaney a widow without
a riding horse!” He laughed reassuringly. “We will
show the British a few stars like that at shorter range,
pretty soon. What say you?”</p>

<p>Morgan waved his tail.
</p>

<p>Next day folk went from everywhere to see the
“fallen star,” and wise old women—&#8203;who infested every
community at that time—&#8203;said it was an ill-omen, and
meant victory for the British!</p>

<p>In the spring of 1814, the American Squadron lay in
Otter Creek, which, flowing gently toward the lake, afforded
safe anchorage for the vessels. In May as they
were about to quit port, the enemy approached off the
mouth of the creek with a well-matured plan to “bottle
them up” by sinking two sloops filled with stones in the
channel. But the Americans fired and frightened them
off before they had played their clever trick.</p>

<p>In the middle of August the “Eagle” was launched
and the murmur arose, “the British are gathering on the
frontier.”</p>

<p>On September third began the real excitement. Before
cock-crow the whole place was astir. Morgan,
feeling the influence, was scarcely able to eat his breakfast.
But when he finally finished, and was led out, the
barracks were alive with soldiers and officers. Morgan
champed his bit—&#8203;ready to be gone on any errand that
was needed. Seconds passed slowly, he was so eager to
be off! In a few moments Lieutenant Van Sicklen
sprang out of a near-by door, and gathering the reins in
his hands swung himself into the saddle.</p>

<p>The old horse was off like a shot toward the goal,
wherever it was, his rider close to his neck, talking to
him as a lady-love might, whispering words of encouragement
and affection.</p>

<p>They dashed down the hill at such speed that an old
cow, lying comfortably in the road, chewing her morning
cud, had the experience of acting as a hurdle. Seeing
she could not possibly rise in time, the young officer
gave Morgan the signal and over her they went! When

she had recovered her stupid senses they were out of
sight.</p>

<p>At last the hopes of the old horse were realized. He
was serving his country and very soon understood the
errand on which they were bent. He spurned the earth;
stone fences stretched across his way; streams had to be
forded; now and then a steep declivity appeared, but he
was a “Bay,” and he remembered what they say of a
bay in the Desert; rough fields, retarding forests, and
wide stretches of valley did not discourage him. Hurrying
on he found naught but broad, fine happiness. He
was serving his country!</p>

<p>White with foam he reached Hinesburg and Lieut.
Van Sicklen shouted:</p>

<p>“The British are coming!”</p>

<p>Then over his shoulder:</p>

<p>“They have invaded Plattsburg and volunteers are
wanted! On to Burlington!”</p>

<p>Every mouth took up the cry.</p>

<p>“On to Burlington, the British are coming!”</p>

<p>Morgan’s nostrils showed red—&#8203;but he was just beginning
this wonderful experience, for which he had waited
so long. On, on, to serve his country!</p>

<p>They left the people hurrying into their houses for
their muskets. Men snatched them from the high mantel-shelves
and started out leaving their plows stuck in
the earth. The women did not weep—&#8203;they, too, set out,
some doggedly, some eager; they begged extra guns and
went along leaving their kitchen doors open and their
pots hanging from the cranes; they had not forgotten
the Indians—&#8203;and that other cry: “The British are coming!”</p>

<p>These were living memories to many. Even the children
pleaded to go along, for was not the American
spirit born in them?
</p>

<p>And on Morgan and his rider went.</p>

<p>“The British are coming!”</p>

<p>The cry rose and fell and echoed through the mountains
and valleys of Vermont.</p>

<p>At last they reached Montpelier where they were to
rest the night at the Farmer’s Inn, where Morgan used
to live. But he was so tired he could not revive memories
of his youth, and lay down on the clean straw to
rest, almost at once.</p>

<p>He did not know how long he had been sleeping when
his keen ears were penetrated by the whisper of men
outside the stable door. He sprang to his four feet, suspiciously.</p>

<p>“’Tis the fleetest horse in the state,” said one voice.
“Have him out and you will signal General Prevost
from the Upper Lake to-morrow night!”</p>

<p>“Prevost! a Red-Coat General!” thought Morgan.
“They must be spies!”</p>

<p>The door was opened softly a moment later, and a
man crept in.</p>

<p>On the instant a rush of air from without swept into
Morgan’s nostrils the unforgotten odor of the Tory Boy
whose dog had killed Black Baby, the lamb. No longer
a boy, he no doubt deserved the kick in accordance with
his increased age and wickedness.</p>

<p>Here surely was the opportunity Allah had been preparing
all these years.</p>

<p>Morgan had been standing with his face to the door,
but, on recognizing the intruder, he wheeled suddenly,
and with a cry, almost human, he delivered the kick of
a lifetime!</p>

<p>Lieutenant Van Sicklen, sleeping near at hand and
ever on the alert, had been roused by Morgan’s first
movement and rushed out with drawn sword. He

reached the open door just in time to receive in his
arms the limp form of the Tory spy.</p>

<p>The American officer was not too surprised to grasp
him by the collar:</p>

<p>“How, now, sirrah! You would steal my horse, would
you? We will soon quiet you and your kind!” Still
holding him firmly—&#8203;though the man was unconscious
and unable to stand—&#8203;he called, “What, ho! Within! I
have no time to deal with spies or horse thieves! Come
out and punish this fellow, if he is alive, according to
your Vermont laws before you go to fight his peers!”</p>

<p>Nor did he and Morgan remain to see the fate of the
Tory spy. It sufficed them to know he was to be dealt
with according to his deserts.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="Footnote_13" href="#FNanchor_13" class="label">[13]</a> In December, 1907, a furled flag, covered with dust and dirt,
and exactly answering the description of the flag examined by
Captain Dulaney, was discovered on the sill of an old barn on
what is now known as the <cite>Jed Mack Farm</cite>, at Swanton Junction,
Vermont. The flag was old—&#8203;even in 1814—&#8203;for there were but
thirteen stripes on it, and had been made before Vermont was
admitted to the Union.</p>

<h3>THE NAVAL BATTLE.</h3>


<p>From Montpelier other messengers were sent in all
directions to warn the farmers, and Lieut. Van Sicklen
pushed on to Randolph, Morgan’s old home. His
former friends along the way would never have believed
it, had they not known his age. Full twenty-five years
old, he was yet eager, and, hard as the riding had been,
not once had he faltered.</p>

<p>Whilst he waited in Randolph, Lieut. Van Sicklen,
amidst roars of applause, roused the people to rally
round the flag, and made such a patriotic speech from
the porch of Dr. Timothy Baylies’ Tavern, that the assembled
crowd was carried away by his enthusiasm and
shouted, wildly:</p>

<p>“Down with the British!”</p>

<p>It was a fire of patriotism burning high and clear,
lighting the state from North to South.</p>

<p>Presently, on foot, on horseback, in wagons and in
“shays,” they swept out into the winding highways and
headed toward Montpelier, where the Government arms
were stored, with a great cracking of whips and cheering.</p>

<p>Eighty-five volunteers went from Randolph, with Captain
Egerton Lebbins in command. In a fine fever of
enthusiasm they were as splendid a set of men as Morgan
had come across in his journey, showing much heroism
and ardor, but their clothes were odd to see, goodness
knows! One thing and another thrown on at random;

but not once did it occur to any of them to doubt
the propriety of the strange costumes.</p>

<p>Fortunate ones had entire buff and blue Continental
uniforms, inherited from father or grandfather or once
worn by themselves—&#8203;which was a proud boast—&#8203;some
were stained darkly, telling the tale of another war.
Others had brass buttons hastily sewn on their everyday
coats. Still others had but one button—&#8203;a sort of
badge—&#8203;but these were great treasures, for did they not
bear the inscription, “Long live our President,” and did
they not have his initials—&#8203;G. W.—&#8203;on them?</p>

<p>Their arms, when they started out, were as varied as
their coats. Hunting knives, long muskets, spears made
at the forge, of scraps of iron tied to oak staffs with raw
hide, Indian arrow heads stuck into short hickory handles,
and such like.</p>

<p>But after all, the wonder was that they could get together
any sort of suggestive garb, or cared to—&#8203;New
England being in such a fever of dissatisfaction over the
war.</p>

<p>Their mission completed, Lieut. Van Sicklen and Morgan
returned to Burlington, and the day following this,
Captain Dulaney rode his horse down to the wharf and,
with many other officers, boarded the boat for Plattsburg.</p>

<p>The leaky old sloop, used to convey Captain Lebbins’
“heroes” across, was washed up on Juniper Island in a
storm of rain, and great was the anxiety concerning the
brave fellows. A life boat was hurriedly manned and
sent to their rescue—&#8203;instead of finding the soldiers <em>perishing
properly</em>, in true shipwreck fashion, the life-saving
party found them celebrating their patriotism with
Medford rum, high and dry on the island! “The wreck
of Juniper Island” was the subject of many a song and
story for long years in Randolph.
</p>

<p>Commodore Macdonough’s fleet was anchored off
Plattsburg with fourteen vessels and eighty-six guns.
On shore could be heard from the deck of his flagship,
“Saratoga,” the Commodore giving orders, in that cool,
calm voice—&#8203;so loved by Decatur and Bainbridge—&#8203;the
voice that indicated at once courage, humanity and confidence.
Nor were these qualities at all disturbed by the
rumor that a “host was advancing down the lake to
crush the Yankees!”</p>

<p>The “host” was Captain George Downie, on his flagship,
“Confiance,” with a flotilla of sixteen vessels carrying
ninety-two guns.</p>

<p>It was now the eve of a great naval engagement—&#8203;the
tenth of September, eighteen hundred and fourteen—&#8203;the
story of which has been told over and over for generations.</p>

<p>Near Captain Dulaney’s headquarters, Morgan slept
little that night; across the lake Burlington throbbed
with flaring lights, and the town about him was wide
awake. He dreamed waking dreams of his ancestor,
the Turk, ridden by Captain Byerly, in King William’s
wars, one hundred and twenty-five years before—&#8203;the
Byerly Turk, he was called—&#8203;who had seen the glories
of Londonderry and Enniskillan.</p>

<p>Of another ancestor, too, he dreamed, the White
Turk, ridden by Oliver Cromwell; and now he, Morgan,
was taking part in a war under the saddle of his
Lady’s soldier—&#8203;for this reason an even greater personage
than Captain Byerly or Oliver Cromwell!</p>

<p>Long before dawn on the eleventh, his owner rode
him out to watch the maneuvers on the lake from an
eminence, for it now seemed that Morgan was not to
take an active part in this battle.</p>

<p>Commodore Macdonough had drawn his fleet up in
two lines, forty yards apart, and as daylight came, and

the morning advanced, the force weighed anchor and
moved forward in a body. The wind was fair and at
eight bells all was ready for the approaching enemy—&#8203;not
more than a league away.</p>

<p>As the British ships came nearer the Americans swung
their broadsides to bear—&#8203;an intense stillness fell whose
influence extended to the watchers on land.</p>

<p>The “Saratoga” was silent—&#8203;waiting—&#8203;every man at
his post, every nerve at the highest tension—&#8203;some in
fear, some in restraint, some in suspense—&#8203;but every ear
astrain against the rending of that awful silence.</p>

<p>And suddenly it was rent!</p>

<p>A cock, escaped from a coop, having mounted a gun-slide,
on the “Saratoga,” stretched his neck, flapped his
wings, and crowed!</p>

<p>His defiance of the British was answered with a rousing
cheer—&#8203;the strain was broken—&#8203;the depressed revived!</p>

<p>It was an omen presaging Victory, the Americans
said.</p>

<p>Commodore Macdonough, himself, fired the first gun
from the flagship. Death shrieked through the air, ugly
and resistless; the ball fairly mowed down the men as it
whizzed the entire deck-length of the “Confiance.”</p>

<p>The men on the Saratoga shivered as the smoke lifted
and they saw the devastation and the gallant enemy
advance, without reply. Then at the distance of a quarter
of a mile Captain Downie anchored and the other
British vessels came to.</p>

<p>The Americans continued to pound away—&#8203;still the
“Confiance” did not respond until secured. Then, with
startling suddenness she seemed to point all her guns at
the “Saratoga” and become a solid sheet of flame. The
air rocked with the blazing of the cannon.
</p>

<p>This broadside, from point-blank range, carried destruction
to its target. It came terribly, and in turn
sang its death-song to the Americans through the morning
air.</p>

<p>When the eddying smoke cleared it seemed to Commodore
Macdonough that he saw half his crew lying on
the deck, stunned, wounded or killed by this one discharge—&#8203;forty
was the actual number, out of his two
hundred and twelve men. Hammocks were cut to
pieces in the netting and bodies cumbered the deck. But
presently the “Saratoga” recovered and resumed her animated
fire, steady as ever.</p>

<p>Fifteen minutes after the enemy anchored an English
vessel was captured, and on Crab Island where there
was a hospital and a battery of one gun, the “invalids”
took a second.</p>

<p>Sometimes the galleys of the two navies would lie
within a boat’s hook of each other and the sailors, not
liking such close quarters, would rise from the sweeps,
ready to spring into the water. It was close and hot—&#8203;this
little naval battle—&#8203;but gradually, as the guns were
injured, the cannonading ceased.</p>

<p>Morgan and Captain Dulaney galloped from place to
place for a better view, the old horse prancing at the terrific
sound of the firing, never having seemed so full of
spirit; constantly he raised his head to sniff the smoke
of battle-as if it were a call from his kins-steeds. The
clatter of his own hoofs beat loud in his ears; his heart
was like to burst with patriotic ardor at the flying flags,
the quick orders of the officers, the martial noises, and
the sense of peril. He was mad with excitement.</p>

<p>Suddenly from the men on shore burst a cheer, loud
and high in exultation; the feeling of pride ran hot in
Morgan’s veins, he tasted all the sweets of conquest,

and raising his head high, added his voice to theirs in
a great cry of triumph.</p>

<p>And this was Victory! It was worth—&#8203;that one moment—&#8203;his
whole long life of hard work and painful partings!

<h3>DOWN HILL.</h3>


<p>For days after the naval battle Morgan seemed rejuvenated,
ready to begin life all over; life, with its
changes of owners, its partings, its hard work—&#8203;but
withal, its friendships, its moments of supreme joy and
exaltation.</p>

<p>It might be well to end the story of old Justin Morgan
as he stood there—&#8203;so fine in his spirit and ambition—&#8203;watching
the fight from the hill commanding the lake;
but one or two more incidents remain to be related which
will show still greater powers of endurance and patience
in his long, hard, but nevertheless, noble life.</p>

<p>On the heels of the American victory came the news
that the Dulaneys had been ordered back to West Point,
and would not take Morgan with them. It was a bitter
parting for the old horse and need not be dwelt upon.
All three realized fully, they should never meet again.</p>

<hr class="tb">

<p>From Burlington Morgan was sold to Joel Goss and
Joseph Rogers, and taken to Claremont, New Hampshire.
Here his stable was at the ferry, on the Connecticut
River, and the sight of the stream recalled his
youth.</p>

<p>He dreamed sweet dreams of colthood; visions of his
mother, of Caesar, of Black Baby, came to him and he
was content.</p>

<p>But, alas, this pleasant, peaceful life ended full soon,
and, in 1816 he was sold to a man by the name of Langmaid,

who drove the freight-stage from Windsor to
Chelsea, a distance of nearly two hundred miles. Thus
the brave old animal, at twenty-seven years of age, was
ignominiously thrust into harness company with five
other lazy, ill-bred brutes, who dawdled along the road
with slack tugs and made the patient Morgan do most
of the pulling.</p>

<p>For the first time in his long life the ambitious horse
admitted a feeling of discouragement into his heart; he
was ill-fed, never rubbed down, and life seemed utterly
hopeless.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>That was the year men called “Eighteen-hundred-and-starved-to-death,”
and throughout the entire summer
there was not one warm, sunshiny day.</p>

<p>Growing wet with their intolerably toilsome exertions
over the slippery, tumbling roads, with the wind howling
and the trees bending low about them, the horses

would become chilled to the bone, with often nothing
but hemlock boughs to eat. They panted and strained
as they climbed, and the lumbering stage, with its
heavy load of freight, had to be hauled over the tops of
the almost perpendicular hills and mountains, at the
crack of a long, keen whip in the hands of a merciless
driver; every moment they were in danger of crashing
over an embankment. It took steady nerve to do this,
and poor, proud Morgan, who had never before felt a
whip, chafed under the treatment and the remarks of
people who had known him in his prime.</p>

<p>He almost fretted himself to death, he was heartsick,
and a leaden weariness of battling came over him; he
was in a pitiable plight.</p>

<p>That year crops were all killed, famine threatened,
and once more Vermont drank the cup of desolation to
its dregs. Good church people, with their children
starving, cursed their God.</p>

<p>On one occasion the stage passed the farm of a man
driven to desperation by the conditions—&#8203;no crops—&#8203;no
food. He did not hear the stage coming—&#8203;the horses’
feet fell noiselessly on the soundless road, knee-deep—&#8203;the
heavy wheels half hidden—&#8203;in mud. There he stood,
his Bible in his hand, and in a loud voice he poured
forth a torrent of threats “to burn the Book if his crops
were killed by the threatening frost.”</p>

<p>Mother Nature had made her plans, and did not
change them for such impious railings.</p>

<p>When the stage passed, a few days later, neighbors’
tongues buzzed with Diah Brewster’s blasphemy, for he
had kept his word!</p>

<p>No one could suggest a punishment to fit the crime,
although there were stocks and branding for lesser misdemeanors,
such as drunkenness and lying.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, the stage had to go on before the

driver found out what decision the Selectmen arrived at
as to proper and appropriate penalty.</p>

<p>Soon after this Joseph Rogers chanced to be in Chelsea
when the stage coach drew up. Hearing his familiar
voice, Morgan—&#8203;wretchedly miserable and homesick—&#8203;gave
a friendly and anxious whinney. Rogers would
never have recognized him otherwise, but as he looked
into the horse’s kind, gentle face he knew it was his old
friend. He started in surprise at the forlorn appearance
of the once beautiful horse, now friendless and forgotten.</p>

<p>That evening Morgan was bought back by Joel Goss
and Joseph Rogers, who took him again to Claremont,
where he soon regained strength and flesh. His coat
took on such a gloss that after a while they began to
“spruce” him up for the Randolph Fair. And at twenty-eight
years of age!</p>

<p>The fair proved to be a very fine one and there were
bread-stuffs, pies and quilts of every description, linen
and woolen woven by the women, and the men exhibited
their fine horses, cows and pigs.</p>

<p>Morgan’s stable was as popular as ever and pretty
soon the judges gave him a blue ribband, though there
were many younger horses in his class who arched their
necks and attracted attention.</p>

<p>The chief topic of conversation at the fair was the
approaching visit of President James Monroe, who was
coming to view the scene of the great naval battle at
Burlington. Morgan heard the talk outside his stall.</p>

<p>“They tell me the Morgan goes up to Burlington for
the President to ride in the big parade,” said a stable
boy.</p>

<p>“Yes,” some one replied, “Joel Goss wants to sell the
horse and thinks with the reputation of having been ridden
by a President he’ll get a better price!”
</p>

<p>“That sounds reasonable—&#8203;if Morgan was younger.”</p>

<p>“Younger? Why, man, this horse’ll never grow old!
Wait and take a look at him.”</p>

<p>The “old” horse was led out, bold and ambitious, his
eyes bright, his ears pointing, his spirit fresh as ever!
He stepped smartly about, supple and sound as a horse
of ten, at the most. It is the spirit that makes the horse
and there was a springiness of youth in his gait. Well
had he known—&#8203;this wise animal—&#8203;that every trait and
characteristic he developed in himself would be his gift
to posterity! His feeling of responsibility to future
generations was great.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>A week later the Morgan was led to the Tavern entrance
in Burlington. He stepped nobly, and understood
all the paces and evolutions of a showy parade-horse.</p>

<p>At the door of the Tavern appeared a man, noticeable
for that dignified and courtly bearing that marked the
Colonial gentleman. He was attired in a costume of
the latest cut—&#8203;somewhat new to the Vermonters.</p>

<p>He raised his hat and bowed to the right and left as
cheer after cheer rose from the people who recognized
their President.</p>

<p>Accompanied by General Joseph G. Swift, he started
down the steps.</p>

<p>Suddenly over the face of President James Monroe
there passed a look of keen interest, followed by one of
intense admiration.</p>

<p>He had caught sight of Morgan, and his eye, unerring
in its judgment of horseflesh, was arrested at once by

his vigorous and fearless style. He turned to a group
of officials.</p>

<p>“I see, gentlemen,” he said, in a tone of genuine appreciation,
“that Vermont can produce a horse worthy of
her heroes!”</p>

<p>A moment later and he had thrown his leg over the
back of the proudest horse in America!</p>


<p class="p2 center allsmcap">THE END.</p>

<p class="p2">Morgan passed the remainder of his life in the kind
care of Mr. Bean, of Chelsea. He died from the effects
of a kick from another horse, in 1821, at the advanced
age of thirty-two years.

this month, and seeing an article in your last in praise of
the Morgan Horse, I want to add a word of gratitude for their
noble service done me as a stage-proprietor on the Fourth New
Hampshire Town-pike; as livery man and farmer…. For
endurance, intelligence and as trappy drivers, the Morgans have
no equals. To handle six or eight horses on a stage-coach over
hills—&#8203;without accident—&#8203;looks to me wonderful now, for brakes
were not known in those days. I sometimes think it could not
have been done without the Morgan horses, for their superior intelligence
was often displayed in cases of danger—&#8203;like running on
icy, sidling roads, where every tug was needed, and the horses
on the run, to prevent the coach from falling off the bank! I
have often done this and seen others do it, and accidents were
few. These horses seemed to know what was wanted and understood
the danger as well as the driver. It was sometimes no easy
matter to carry the mails through blinding sleet and heavy drifts,
but I never had a Morgan horse look back to refuse me. They
always faced the blast. If a double trip had to be made the
<em>Morgans</em> always did it and the long-jointed, over-reaching, interfering
span of some other breed was kept in the barn.</p>

<p>The stable of the late George Houstoun Waring, of
Savannah, at Annandale Stock Farm, where the first
Georgia Morgans were raised, consisted of four Morgans
brought from Vermont and New Hampshire. They were,
<span class="smcap">Enterprise</span>, No. 423, chestnut with flaxen mane and tail;
<span class="smcap">Paragon Black Hawk</span>, the handsomest horse I ever
saw, black with white star, very showy in tandem; <span class="smcap">Clive</span>,
beyond compare in Morgan perfection, for whom, at four
years of age Mr. Waring refused $4,000; <span class="smcap">Bay Comet</span>,
perfect in form and disposition, dark with black points.
There were fifty mares, nearly all Morgans. The finest
of these was <span class="smcap">Rosalie Morgan</span>, from Vermont. She was
exhibited many years at the Georgia State Fairs, and at
each would take the prizes for the best brood mare, best
mare with colt at her side, and best trotting mare. When
she appeared in these three classes no other mare stood
any chance. Finally she was ruled out. She had nineteen
colts, two of which I know sold for $600 each.
Rosalie died at thirty-two years of age.</p>

<p>I bought from Mr. Waring a Bay Comet colt, daughter
of <span class="smcap">Amanda Morgan</span>, and named her <span class="smcap">Jeannie Dean</span>.
Jeannie was like a member of my family for thirty-one
years. She was the perfect type in character and form.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Frank</span>, a grandson of <span class="smcap">Enterprise</span>, one of the later
and best known Morgans was owned and trotted by
William Henry Stiles, in 2:18¼; he inherited all the fine
traits of “<span class="smcap">Old Justin Morgan</span>.”</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Annandale</span> had a half-mile track, and every equipment
for the care and comfort of this transplanted race.
</p>

<p>The farm was situated in Habersham Co., in a luxuriant
rolling valley of the beautiful mountainous section of
Northeast Georgia; a section almost exclusively occupied
by the summer estates of the wealthy rice and cotton
planters of the Low Country.</p>
